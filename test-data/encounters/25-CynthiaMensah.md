- Time: 14:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Specialist Clinic
- Organization: Kingston Health Sciences Centre — Nephrology
- Practitioner: Dr. Fatima Al-Rashid, MD FRCPC (ON-PRAC-79207)
- Reason for visit: CKD stage 3a follow-up, eGFR trending, laboratory review

### Subjective
Mrs. Mensah is referred back by Dr. Whitfield for ongoing CKD co-management. She reports no uremic symptoms — no nausea, pruritus, or anorexia. Energy is reasonable. Denies any changes to urination pattern, no nocturia beyond once nightly which is her baseline. No edema. She has been compliant with losartan 50 mg daily and vitamin D3. She has been avoiding NSAIDs. She asks whether her kidney function is worsening. She is concerned because a family member was recently started on dialysis.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 124/76 mmHg, HR 70 bpm, Weight: 73.8 kg
- General: Well-appearing, comfortable
- Cardiovascular: Normal heart sounds, no murmur
- Respiratory: Clear
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender
- Extremities: No edema
- Labs (drawn 2024-05-14):
  - Creatinine: 106 umol/L
  - eGFR: 51 mL/min/1.73m2
  - Urine ACR: 4.5 mg/mmol (A2, mildly elevated)
  - Potassium: 4.4 mmol/L
  - Sodium: 139 mmol/L
  - Bicarbonate: 23 mmol/L
  - Calcium: 2.30 mmol/L
  - Phosphate: 1.12 mmol/L
  - PTH: 5.8 pmol/L (mildly elevated, consistent with CKD 3a)
  - Hemoglobin: 126 g/L
  - Ferritin: 68 ug/L
  - Iron saturation: 24%

### Assessment
1. CKD stage 3a (G3a, A2) — eGFR stable in the 51-54 range over the past 18 months. No accelerated decline. Mild albuminuria persistent but not worsening. Electrolytes balanced. PTH mildly elevated as expected for CKD stage 3a — does not require treatment at this time. Renal ultrasound (2023) was normal.
2. Blood pressure well-controlled on losartan — at target for CKD (< 130/80).
3. Mild normocytic anemia — hemoglobin 126, iron stores adequate. Likely early renal anemia. Not yet requiring erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.
4. Cardiovascular risk — no statin yet. Recommend discussing with family physician.

### Plan
1. Continue losartan 50 mg daily — providing good renoprotection and BP control. No dose adjustment needed.
2. Continue vitamin D3 1000 IU daily.
3. Monitor PTH — recheck in 6-9 months. If rising above 7-8 pmol/L, consider calcitriol or dose adjustment of vitamin D.
4. Monitor hemoglobin — if falls below 100 g/L, will investigate further and consider ESA. Iron stores adequate for now.
5. Reassured patient regarding stable kidney function. Explained the difference between her CKD trajectory and dialysis risk. Her risk of requiring dialysis in the next 5-10 years is low if function remains stable.
6. NSAID avoidance reinforced. Also discussed avoidance of nephrotoxic agents (e.g., contrast dye — if imaging needed, ensure pre-hydration and discuss with nephrology).
7. Repeat labs in 6 months: creatinine, eGFR, urine ACR, electrolytes, CBC, PTH, calcium, phosphate.
8. Report and recommendations to be sent to Dr. Whitfield.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 9-12 months (nephrology), sooner if eGFR declines or new concerns
- Referrals: None; report to Dr. Whitfield

## Encounter 6: 2025-03-25 — Nephrology Follow-up

- Date: 2025-03-25
- Time: 13:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Specialist Clinic
- Organization: Kingston Health Sciences Centre — Nephrology
- Practitioner: Dr. Fatima Al-Rashid, MD FRCPC (ON-PRAC-79207)
- Reason for visit: CKD stage 3a follow-up, eGFR trending, laboratory review

### Subjective
Mrs. Mensah returns for nephrology follow-up. She was last seen here in May 2024. She reports no new symptoms. No edema, no changes in urinary habits. Nocturia once per night, unchanged. Energy is adequate. She has been tolerating all medications well. She has been started on atorvastatin 10 mg since her last nephrology visit and reports no side effects. She has been managing her diet and avoiding NSAIDs. She notes some stress related to family matters but is coping.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 130/80 mmHg, HR 72 bpm, Weight: 74.4 kg
- General: Well-appearing, alert
- Cardiovascular: S1 S2 normal, no murmur, no S3
- Respiratory: Clear
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender
- Extremities: No edema, no skin changes
- Labs (drawn 2025-03-18):
  - Creatinine: 110 umol/L
  - eGFR: 49 mL/min/1.73m2
  - Urine ACR: 5.1 mg/mmol (A2)
  - Potassium: 4.6 mmol/L
  - Sodium: 140 mmol/L
  - Bicarbonate: 22 mmol/L
  - Calcium: 2.28 mmol/L

  - Hemoglobin: 122 g/L
  - Ferritin: 58 ug/L
  - Iron saturation: 22%

### Assessment
1. CKD stage 3a (G3a, A2) — eGFR 49, gradual decline from 52 (March 2024) to 49 over 12 months. Estimated annual eGFR decline approximately 3 mL/min/1.73m2. This is at the upper end of expected age-related decline combined with CKD progression. Not yet alarming but warrants close monitoring. If rate of decline exceeds 5 mL/min/year, will escalate management.
2. Albuminuria — urine ACR 5.1, mildly increased. Persistent A2 category. Losartan is providing partial renoprotection.
3. Secondary hyperparathyroidism — PTH 6.4, mild progression. Calcium and phosphate still within normal limits. Vitamin D level was adequate in March 2024.
4. Bicarbonate 22 — trending down. At risk for metabolic acidosis which can accelerate CKD progression. Consider oral bicarbonate supplementation if falls below 22.
5. Mild anemia — hemoglobin 122, gradual decline. Iron stores borderline low. Not yet requiring ESA.
6. BP 130/80 — at threshold. May benefit from tighter control.

### Plan
1. Continue losartan 50 mg daily. Recommend Dr. Whitfield consider increasing to 100 mg if BP remains at or above 130/80 on serial readings, for additional renoprotection and BP control.
2. Continue atorvastatin 10 mg daily.
3. Continue vitamin D3 1000 IU daily. Recheck 25-OH vitamin D at next lab draw.
4. Monitor bicarbonate closely. If < 22 on next draw, recommend starting sodium bicarbonate 650 mg PO BID to slow CKD progression (per KDIGO guidelines).
5. Iron supplementation: start ferrous fumarate 300 mg PO daily to replete iron stores and support erythropoiesis. Recheck ferritin and iron saturation in 3 months.
6. Repeat labs in 6 months: creatinine, eGFR, urine ACR, electrolytes, CBC, calcium, phosphate, PTH, ferritin, iron saturation, 25-OH vitamin D.
7. Counsel patient on adequate fluid intake and continued NSAID avoidance. Discussed importance of informing any treating physician about CKD before imaging studies requiring contrast.
8. Report to Dr. Whitfield with above recommendations.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 9 months (nephrology), or sooner if eGFR declines further or new symptoms
- Referrals: Report and recommendations to Dr. Whitfield

### Subjective
Cynthia returns to review nephrology recommendations from Dr. Al-Rashid (March 2025). She has started ferrous fumarate 300 mg daily as recommended. She reports mild constipation since starting iron, manageable with increased fibre and water. She asks about the suggestion to increase losartan. She has been checking her blood pressure at a pharmacy kiosk and reports readings mostly 128-134/78-82. No dizziness, no lightheadedness. No edema. No new symptoms. She continues part-time caregiving work. Her mother's health in Ghana has stabilized, reducing her stress.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 132/80 mmHg (seated), HR 70 bpm, Weight: 74.2 kg
- General: Well-appearing
- Cardiovascular: Normal

  - Iron saturation: 26%

### Assessment
1. CKD stage 3a — eGFR 49, stable from March 2025. Encouraging.
2. Hypertension — BP consistently at 130/80 threshold. Per CKD guidelines and nephrology recommendation, increasing losartan is appropriate for additional renoprotection.
3. Potassium 4.7 — acceptable but will need monitoring with losartan dose increase. If rises above 5.5, will need to reconsider.
4. Bicarbonate 22 — at the threshold. Will monitor one more cycle before starting bicarbonate supplementation.
5. Iron status improving on ferrous fumarate — ferritin up from 58 to 72. Hemoglobin stable at 124.
6. Constipation from iron — mild, managed with lifestyle measures.

### Plan
1. Increase losartan to 100 mg PO daily (from 50 mg). Counsel on monitoring for dizziness or lightheadedness. Recheck potassium and creatinine in 2 weeks after dose increase.
2. Continue ferrous fumarate 300 mg daily. Advise taking on an empty stomach or with vitamin C for absorption. May take every other day if constipation worsens.
3. Continue atorvastatin 10 mg daily.
4. Continue vitamin D3 1000 IU daily.
5. Recheck in 2 weeks: potassium, creatinine, eGFR (post-losartan increase safety check).

  - Phosphate: 1.12 mmol/L
  - PTH: 6.2 pmol/L (stable, slightly improved from 6.4)
  - Hemoglobin: 128 g/L
  - Ferritin: 96 ug/L
  - Iron saturation: 27%
  - 25-OH vitamin D: 74 nmol/L

### Assessment
1. CKD stage 3a (G3a, A2) — eGFR 48, stable over the past 9 months. The rate of decline has clearly slowed since losartan was increased to 100 mg. Albuminuria is improving (3.8, down from 5.1 peak). This is an encouraging trajectory.
2. Blood pressure — excellent control at 122/74 on losartan 100 mg. At target.
3. Secondary hyperparathyroidism — PTH 6.2, stable. Calcium and phosphate within normal limits. No intervention required.
4. Anemia — hemoglobin 128, improved. Ferritin 96, approaching target. Iron supplementation has been effective.
5. Bicarbonate 23 — stable, no supplementation needed.
6. Vitamin D — adequate at 74 nmol/L, continue supplementation.

### Plan
1. Continue current medications: losartan 100 mg daily, atorvastatin 10 mg daily, vitamin D3 1000 IU daily.
2. Ferrous fumarate: may discontinue once ferritin > 100. Continue every other day for now; recheck in 3 months. If ferritin > 100 and hemoglobin stable, can stop.
3. Continue monitoring renal function and electrolytes every 6 months. Next nephrology-directed labs in June 2026.
4. Reviewed potassium: 4.7 on losartan 100 mg. Acceptable. Counsel to avoid potassium-rich salt substitutes and excessive high-potassium foods.
5. Prognosis discussion: eGFR has stabilized around 48. At current trajectory, unlikely to progress to stage 4 in the near term. Ongoing monitoring and medication adherence are key.
6. Continue NSAID avoidance and contrast precautions.
7. Report and recommendations to Dr. Whitfield.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 9-12 months (nephrology), around September-December 2026
- Referrals: Report to Dr. Whitfield

## Encounter 10: 2026-02-17 — FP Follow-up / Labs / Medication Renewal

- Date: 2026-02-17
- Time: 10:15
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Kingston Family Health Organization, 115 Clarence St, Kingston, ON
- Practitioner: Dr. James Whitfield, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-67812)
- Reason for visit: Routine CKD follow-up, laboratory review, medication renewal

### Subjective
Cynthia presents for her routine follow-up and medication renewal. She reports feeling well overall. No new complaints. She received her COVID-19 booster in January 2026 without adverse effects. Energy levels are stable. No edema, no changes in urinary pattern. She mentions occasional mild knee stiffness in the mornings, lasting about 10-15 minutes and then resolving. She has been using acetaminophen PRN with good effect and has not taken any NSAIDs. She continues to work part-time caregiving, three days per week. She reports good adherence to all medications. She stopped ferrous fumarate approximately two weeks ago as her supply ran out and asks whether she should continue.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 126/76 mmHg (seated, left arm), HR 70 bpm, Temp 36.5 C, Weight: 73.8 kg
- General: Well-appearing, comfortable
- Cardiovascular: S1 S2 normal, no murmurs
- Respiratory: Clear bilaterally
- Extremities: No peripheral edema, no joint effusion in knees bilaterally, mild crepitus on passive flexion of left knee
- MSK: Full ROM bilateral knees, no instability
- Labs (drawn 2026-02-10):
  - Creatinine: 111 umol/L
  - eGFR: 48 mL/min/1.73m2
  - Urine ACR: 3.6 mg/mmol (A2, continuing to improve)
  - Potassium: 4.6 mmol/L
  - Sodium: 141 mmol/L
  - Bicarbonate: 23 mmol/L
  - Hemoglobin: 130 g/L
  - Ferritin: 102 ug/L
  - HbA1c: 5.6%
  - ALT: 18 U/L
  - Fasting glucose: 5.1 mmol/L

### Assessment
1. CKD stage 3a (G3a, A2) — eGFR 48, stable for the past 9 months. Albuminuria continuing to improve (3.6, from 4.2 in September and 5.1 peak in March 2025). Losartan 100 mg providing effective renoprotection. Electrolytes stable. Excellent ongoing control.
2. Blood pressure — well-controlled at 126/76 on losartan 100 mg. At target for CKD.
3. Iron status — ferritin 102, goal achieved. Hemoglobin 130, improved from nadir of 122. Iron supplementation can be discontinued.
4. Dyslipidemia — well-controlled on atorvastatin 10 mg. ALT normal.
5. Prediabetes — HbA1c 5.6%, improved from 5.7%. Fasting glucose normal. Lifestyle measures effective.
6. Mild osteoarthritis, left knee — morning stiffness < 30 minutes, mechanical pattern. Managed with acetaminophen. No inflammatory features. NSAID avoidance essential given CKD.
7. Health maintenance: COVID-19 booster completed Jan 2026. Influenza vaccine Oct 2025. FIT negative 2025. Mammography negative 2025.

### Plan
1. Renew medications:
   - Losartan 100 mg PO daily (1-year supply)
   - Atorvastatin 10 mg PO daily (1-year supply)
   - Vitamin D3 1000 IU PO daily (OTC, continue)
2. Discontinue ferrous fumarate — ferritin target > 100 achieved, hemoglobin stable. Will recheck in 6 months to ensure hemoglobin remains stable off iron.
3. Knee stiffness: reassurance. Continue acetaminophen 500-1000 mg PRN (max 3 g/day). Encourage gentle exercise, weight maintenance. Strict NSAID avoidance reiterated given CKD. If symptoms worsen, may consider X-ray and physiotherapy referral.
4. Repeat labs in 6 months (August 2026): creatinine, eGFR, urine ACR, electrolytes, CBC, ferritin, calcium, phosphate.
5. Nephrology follow-up anticipated September-December 2026 per Dr. Al-Rashid.
6. FIT screening: next due 2027.
7. Continue lifestyle measures for prediabetes prevention — diet, physical activity.
8. Patient counselled: continue avoiding NSAIDs and nephrotoxic medications. Ensure any prescribing provider is aware of CKD. Hydrate well during illness.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 6 months for routine CKD monitoring, or sooner PRN
- Referrals: None; nephrology follow-up already scheduled
