## Encounter 2: 2024-05-14 — INR Check + FP Visit / Warfarin Management

- Date: 2024-05-14
- Time: 10:15
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Organization
- Organization: Kingston Family Health Organization (115 Clarence St, Kingston, ON K7L 1X4)
- Practitioner: Dr. James Whitfield, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-67812)
- Reason for visit: INR follow-up; warfarin dose adjustment

### Subjective
Mrs. Collins presents for a scheduled INR review. She was contacted by the INR clinic last week after her INR result came back at 1.7 (subtherapeutic). She reports she completed a course of acetaminophen more frequently over the past 2 weeks for increased left knee pain, which she attributes to increased gardening activity in spring. She denies any dietary changes, new medications, herbal supplements, or missed warfarin doses. No bleeding, bruising, melena, hematuria, or epistaxis. No new palpitations, dyspnea, or chest discomfort. No symptoms suggestive of thromboembolic event (no focal neurological deficits, no limb swelling or pain). She confirms she did complete her mammogram (normal result, BI-RADS 1).

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 118/68 mmHg, HR 72 bpm (irregularly irregular), SpO2 97% RA
- Weight: 68.5 kg
- General: Well-appearing, no acute distress
- Cardiovascular: Irregularly irregular, no new murmurs; no peripheral edema
- Lower extremities: No calf swelling, tenderness, or erythema bilaterally
- Left knee: Mild tenderness over medial joint line, small effusion palpable, ROM slightly decreased (0-120 degrees), no warmth or erythema
- INR today: 1.7 (target 2.0-3.0)

### Assessment
1. Subtherapeutic INR — likely multifactorial; high-dose acetaminophen may have contributed (though interaction is modest); possible dietary variation; warfarin dose adjustment required
2. Atrial fibrillation — no symptoms of thromboembolism; rate controlled
3. Left knee osteoarthritis — mild flare with increased activity; small effusion; no signs of infection or inflammatory arthropathy

### Plan
- Warfarin dose adjustment: increase weekly dose by approximately 10% as per INR clinic nomogram; current dose 4 mg daily — increase to 4.5 mg Mon/Wed/Fri, 4 mg other days; recheck INR in 1 week
- Counsel on warfarin interactions — even acetaminophen at higher doses (>2 g/day) can potentiate warfarin; reinforce max 2 g/day
- Left knee OA flare: topical diclofenac gel 1% (Voltaren Emulgel) applied to knee BID-TID; counsel that systemic absorption is minimal but to watch for any bruising; avoid oral NSAIDs
- Ice application to left knee after activity; relative rest from heavy gardening for 1-2 weeks
- Consider physiotherapy referral if knee symptoms do not settle in 4-6 weeks
- Mammogram result reviewed — normal; filed

### Disposition
- Follow-up: INR recheck in 1 week at INR clinic; FP follow-up in 2-3 months or sooner if needed
- Referrals: None at this time

## Encounter 3: 2024-07-18 — Emergency Visit / Fall at Home, Rule Out Fracture

- Date: 2024-07-18
- Time: 14:45
- Type: Emergency
- Setting: Emergency Department
- Organization: Kingston Health Sciences Centre (76 Stuart St, Kingston, ON K7L 2V7)
- Practitioner: Dr. Thomas Beaulieu, MD FRCPC Emergency Medicine (ON-PRAC-74206)
- Reason for visit: Fall at home; left hip and wrist pain; on warfarin anticoagulation

### Subjective
Mrs. Collins is a 76-year-old female brought to the ED by her daughter. She reports tripping over a garden hose in her backyard approximately 2 hours ago. She fell forward, landing on her outstretched left hand and left side. She has pain in her left wrist and left lateral hip. She was able to get up with her daughter's assistance and bear weight, but with discomfort. She denies head strike, loss of consciousness, or dizziness preceding the fall. No palpitations, chest pain, or pre-syncopal symptoms before or after the event. She did not feel unsteady or lightheaded — it was a purely mechanical trip. She is on warfarin for atrial fibrillation. Last known INR was 2.3 (2 weeks ago, therapeutic). No other anticoagulants or antiplatelets. She denies abdominal pain, back pain, or neck pain. No visual changes. Alert throughout.

### Objective

- Fall prevention counselling: remove tripping hazards, adequate footwear outdoors, consider grab bars
- Notify family physician Dr. Whitfield of ED visit (fax report to Kingston FHO)
- Daughter present, aware of plan, able to stay with patient overnight

### Disposition
- Discharged home with daughter
- Follow-up: Family physician within 1-2 weeks for fall risk assessment and wound/injury recheck; repeat wrist X-ray in 10-14 days if snuffbox tenderness persists
- Referrals: None; FP to assess need for formal fall risk evaluation

## Encounter 4: 2024-08-06 — FP Follow-Up Post-Fall / Fall Risk Assessment

- Date: 2024-08-06
- Time: 11:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Organization
- Organization: Kingston Family Health Organization (115 Clarence St, Kingston, ON K7L 1X4)
- Practitioner: Dr. James Whitfield, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-67812)
- Reason for visit: Follow-up after ED visit for fall; fall risk assessment; wrist and hip recheck

### Subjective
Mrs. Collins presents for follow-up after her fall on July 18. She reports that her left wrist is much improved — she discontinued the splint after 10 days; no residual tenderness over the anatomical snuffbox. She still has some mild bruising over her left hip/greater trochanter area, with occasional tenderness when lying on that side, but this is improving. She has been taking acetaminophen intermittently with good effect. She has not fallen again. She reports she has removed the garden hose from the pathway and installed a motion-sensor light in the backyard. Her daughter has been checking in more frequently. Mrs. Collins remains independent in ADLs. She denies any dizziness, lightheadedness, palpitations, or visual changes. No new symptoms. She was worried about whether warfarin made the fall more dangerous and asks about alternatives. Mood good; no anxiety about falling.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 120/70 mmHg, HR 70 bpm (irregularly irregular), SpO2 97% RA
- Weight: 68.4 kg
- General: Well-appearing, in no distress
- Left wrist: No swelling, no tenderness over anatomical snuffbox or distal radius, full ROM, grip strength intact
- Left hip: Fading ecchymosis over greater trochanter, mild residual tenderness on direct palpation, full ROM of hip, gait normal
- Gait assessment: Normal gait, no assistive device needed, able to tandem walk without difficulty
- Timed Up and Go (TUG): 11 seconds (normal <12 seconds for age; borderline — monitor)
- Single-leg stance: 8 seconds left, 10 seconds right (mildly reduced for age)
- Postural BP: Supine 120/70 HR 70; standing 1 min 116/68 HR 76; standing 3 min 114/66 HR 74 — no significant orthostatic drop, no symptoms on standing
- Footwear: Adequate, closed-toe with non-slip soles
- Vision: Last eye exam 2023, no concerns reported
- Cognition: MoCA 27/30 (March 2024) — no repeat needed at this time
- Recent INR (2024-07-30): 2.2 (therapeutic)

### Assessment
1. Post-fall follow-up — mechanical fall, injuries resolved; left wrist contusion healed (no occult scaphoid fracture clinically); left trochanteric contusion resolving
2. Fall risk assessment — TUG borderline at 11 seconds; single-leg stance mildly reduced; no orthostatic hypotension; no cognitive impairment; no visual impairment; no polypharmacy (2 regular medications); main risk factors are age (76), female sex, and anticoagulation
3. Atrial fibrillation — stable on warfarin; patient inquiring about DOAC alternatives
4. Osteoarthritis — stable; left knee symptoms have settled since May flare

### Plan
- Fall prevention: Reviewed home safety checklist — patient has already made environmental modifications; recommend continuing daily walking for conditioning; consider Tai Chi or gentle balance exercises through community centre
- Physiotherapy referral for balance and strengthening program — covered under OHIP in FHT-affiliated programs
- Regarding warfarin vs. DOAC: Discussed options. Warfarin has been well-managed with INR generally therapeutic; DOACs (e.g., apixaban) do not require INR monitoring and have lower intracranial hemorrhage risk. However, Mrs. Collins has been stable on warfarin for years, renal function adequate (eGFR 68), and she is comfortable with the INR clinic routine. Decision: continue warfarin for now; revisit DOAC switch if INR becomes difficult to manage or if patient preference changes. Will discuss with Dr. Hussain (cardiology) at next follow-up
- Continue diltiazem ER 120 mg daily
- Continue acetaminophen PRN for residual hip discomfort
- Ensure eye exam within next 12 months
- Bone density: Confirmed DXA was done 2022 — T-score femoral neck -1.8 (osteopenia). No repeat needed until 2025. Calcium/vitamin D status reviewed: patient takes calcium 500 mg + vitamin D 1000 IU daily (OTC)

### Disposition
- Follow-up: Next scheduled FP visit in 2-3 months; INR clinic ongoing
- Referrals: Physiotherapy (balance and strengthening)

## Encounter 5: 2024-10-22 — Cardiology Follow-Up / AF Rate Control

- Date: 2024-10-22
- Time: 13:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Specialist Clinic
- Organization: Peterborough Regional Specialist Clinic (1 Hospital Dr, Peterborough, ON K9J 7C6) — Outreach by Hamilton General Hospital Cardiology
- Practitioner: Dr. Naveed Hussain, MD FRCPC Cardiology (ON-PRAC-75892)
- Reason for visit: Annual cardiology follow-up for atrial fibrillation; rate control review; anticoagulation discussion

### Subjective
Mrs. Collins presents for her annual cardiology follow-up. She is seen at the Peterborough outreach clinic (closer to her home in Cobourg). She reports no palpitations, no dyspnea on exertion, no chest pain, and no presyncope. She tolerates diltiazem ER 120 mg daily well with no side effects (no constipation, no lower extremity edema, no lightheadedness). Her exercise tolerance is stable — she walks 20-30 minutes daily without limitation. She had a mechanical fall in July (tripped over a garden hose) without serious injury; she is attending physiotherapy for balance exercises. Her family physician raised the question of switching from warfarin to a DOAC. She is open to discussion. No history of valvular heart disease. No prior cardioversion or ablation. AF was diagnosed in 2019.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 122/70 mmHg, HR 68 bpm (irregularly irregular), RR 14, SpO2 97% RA
- Weight: 68.5 kg
- General: Well-appearing, comfortable at rest
- Cardiovascular: Irregularly irregular rhythm at controlled rate, S1/S2 normal, no murmurs, no S3/S4, JVP 3 cm above sternal angle, no peripheral edema
- Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender

Investigations reviewed:
- ECG (done today): Atrial fibrillation, ventricular rate 72 bpm, normal axis, no ST-T changes, no LVH, no bundle branch block. Unchanged from prior.
- Echocardiogram (2023-11): LVEF 55%, normal LV size and wall motion, mild left atrial dilation (42 mm), no significant valvular disease, no pericardial effusion. Reviewed — no repeat needed at this time.
- Recent INR (2024-10-15): 2.6 (therapeutic)
- Cr 80 umol/L, eGFR 66 mL/min/1.73m2 (2024-09)

### Assessment
1. Atrial fibrillation — nonvalvular, permanent, rate-controlled on diltiazem ER 120 mg daily; ventricular rate well controlled (resting HR 68-72 bpm); LVEF preserved; CHADS2-VASc score 4 (age 76, female, no hypertension on current BP readings but historically borderline); anticoagulation mandatory
2. Anticoagulation — warfarin with INRs generally therapeutic; patient and FP have raised question of DOAC switch
3. Left atrial dilation (mild) — stable from 2023 echo; no clinical significance beyond AF substrate
4. Fall in July — mechanical, no cardiac etiology suspected

### Plan
- Continue diltiazem ER 120 mg daily — rate control excellent; no indication to change
- Anticoagulation discussion: Reviewed warfarin vs. apixaban in detail. Advantages of apixaban: no INR monitoring required, lower intracranial hemorrhage risk, fixed dosing, fewer drug-food interactions. Considerations: patient has been well-managed on warfarin, eGFR adequate for apixaban (standard dose 5 mg BID appropriate as she does not meet criteria for dose reduction — weight >60 kg, Cr < 133, age 76). After discussion, Mrs. Collins prefers to remain on warfarin at this time — she values the established routine with the INR clinic and the ability to monitor her level. She will reconsider if monitoring becomes burdensome. Recommend revisiting at next annual follow-up. Communicated decision to Dr. Whitfield.
- No repeat echocardiogram needed at this time — will reassess in 2 years or sooner if symptoms change
- ECG: stable; no conduction abnormalities
- Discussed importance of fall prevention given anticoagulation — patient is attending physiotherapy
- If any symptoms of uncontrolled rate (palpitations, exercise intolerance, new dyspnea), increase diltiazem or consider adding digoxin; currently not indicated

### Disposition
- Follow-up: Cardiology in 12 months (Peterborough outreach or Hamilton as scheduling permits)
- Referrals: None; copy of consultation note to Dr. James Whitfield, Kingston FHO

## Encounter 6: 2025-01-21 — FP Visit / INR Review, OA Pain Management

- Date: 2025-01-21
- Time: 09:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Organization
- Organization: Kingston Family Health Organization (115 Clarence St, Kingston, ON K7L 1X4)
- Practitioner: Dr. James Whitfield, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-67812)
- Reason for visit: INR review; left knee OA pain; medication review

### Subjective
Mrs. Collins presents for a routine visit. She reports her left knee osteoarthritis has been more bothersome over the winter months. The pain is primarily medial, worsening with stairs and prolonged sitting, and rated 5/10 on average. She has been using acetaminophen 500 mg TID with moderate relief. Topical diclofenac gel has been helpful but she ran out and did not repurchase. She completed her physiotherapy course (8 sessions) for balance — she found it very beneficial and continues the home exercises. No falls since July. She occasionally feels stiff in the mornings for about 15-20 minutes, which eases with movement. She denies any locking, giving way, or significant swelling. Right knee (TKA) continues to function well. She is otherwise feeling well. No cardiac symptoms. No bleeding or bruising. Bowels and bladder normal. Appetite good. Sleep occasionally disrupted by knee pain when turning in bed. Mood stable.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 126/74 mmHg, HR 76 bpm (irregularly irregular), SpO2 97% RA
- Weight: 69.1 kg (slight increase)
- Left knee: Mild medial joint line tenderness, small cool effusion, crepitus on flexion, ROM 0-118 degrees (decreased from 130 in March 2024), no warmth, no erythema, stable ligaments, negative McMurray test
- Right knee: Well-healed TKA scar, no effusion, ROM 0-115 degrees, stable
- Gait: Mildly antalgic on left, no assistive device
- Recent INR (2025-01-14): 2.1 (therapeutic, lower end of range)
- Labs (2024-12): CBC normal, Cr 80 umol/L, eGFR 66, fasting glucose 5.4 mmol/L

### Assessment
1. Left knee osteoarthritis — progressive; increasing symptoms over winter; decreased ROM from prior; conservative management partially effective
2. Atrial fibrillation — stable on warfarin and diltiazem; INR therapeutic
3. Weight: 69.1 kg — slight increase (0.4 kg from baseline); likely winter deconditioning and reduced activity

### Plan
- OA management — escalate conservative therapy:
  - Renew topical diclofenac gel 1% (Voltaren Emulgel) — apply TID to left knee; counsel that this is preferred over oral NSAIDs given warfarin
  - Continue acetaminophen 500 mg TID (1.5 g/day) — may increase to 500 mg QID (2 g/day) if needed; do not exceed 2 g/day given age
  - Encourage weight management — even modest weight loss of 2-3 kg may help knee symptoms; dietitian referral offered but patient declines at this time
  - Continue home exercise program from physiotherapy; consider additional physiotherapy sessions if symptoms worsen
  - Knee sleeve/brace for support during prolonged walking
  - If symptoms continue to progress despite conservative measures, consider orthopedic referral for assessment (possible corticosteroid injection or surgical evaluation for left knee)
- Warfarin: INR 2.1, lower therapeutic range; maintain current dose; recheck in 4 weeks; counsel regarding diet consistency (winter comfort foods — soups with leafy greens can affect INR)
- Continue diltiazem ER 120 mg daily
- Ensure influenza vaccine (completed November 2024 per chart) and COVID booster if eligible
- Bone density scan due 2025 — schedule DXA

### Disposition
- Follow-up: INR clinic ongoing; FP in 3 months for annual physical
- Referrals: Orthopedics referral to be considered if OA symptoms do not improve by spring

- Setting: Family Health Organization
- Organization: Kingston Family Health Organization (115 Clarence St, Kingston, ON K7L 1X4)
- Practitioner: Dr. James Whitfield, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-67812)
- Reason for visit: Annual health examination; comprehensive geriatric assessment; medication review

### Subjective
Mrs. Collins presents for her annual physical. She turns 77 in May. She reports feeling reasonably well overall but notes that her left knee continues to limit some activities — she has difficulty with stairs and has reduced her daily walks to 15-20 minutes (from 30 minutes previously). The topical diclofenac and acetaminophen provide partial relief. She has not fallen since July 2024 and continues her balance exercises at home. She is independent in all ADLs; IADLs intact — she drives, manages her own finances, shops independently, and prepares meals. She still lives alone in Cobourg. Her daughter visits weekly and calls daily. She denies any cognitive concerns — no difficulty with memory, word-finding, or managing her medications. She uses a weekly pill organizer. No mood concerns. She has been socially active — attends church and a weekly book club. Sleep is fair, occasionally disrupted by knee discomfort. No cardiac symptoms. No bleeding or bruising. Continence maintained. No new symptoms. She inquires about her bone density scan.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 128/72 mmHg, HR 72 bpm (irregularly irregular), RR 16, Temp 36.4 C, SpO2 97% RA
- Weight: 68.3 kg (improved from January), BMI: 25.7
- General: Well-appearing, well-groomed, no acute distress
- HEENT: Hearing — mild bilateral high-frequency hearing loss noted (patient reports difficulty in noisy environments); no cerumen impaction; pupils equal and reactive; oropharynx clear; dentition fair
- Cardiovascular: Irregularly irregular, rate controlled, no murmurs, no edema
- Respiratory: Clear bilaterally
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no masses
- Musculoskeletal: Left knee — medial tenderness, crepitus, ROM 0-115 degrees, mild varus alignment beginning to develop, no effusion today. Right knee (TKA) — stable, full expected ROM
- Skin: No suspicious lesions; annual skin check unremarkable
- Neurological: Alert and oriented x3, gait mildly antalgic on left, tandem gait intact
- Functional screening:
  - MoCA: 27/30 (same as prior — stable)
  - PHQ-2: 0/6
  - Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-5): 0/5
  - TUG: 12 seconds (slightly increased from 11 seconds in August 2024)
  - Single-leg stance: 7 seconds left, 9 seconds right
  - ADL screen: Independent in all basic and instrumental ADLs
  - Driving screen: No concerns reported by patient or family; no red flags on cognitive screening
- DXA (2025-03-20): Femoral neck T-score -2.0 (osteopenia, progressed from -1.8 in 2022); lumbar spine T-score -1.5
- Labs (2025-03-28): INR 2.3, CBC normal, Cr 82 umol/L, eGFR 64, fasting glucose 5.3, HbA1c 5.5%, TSH 2.3, vitamin D 72 nmol/L (adequate), calcium 2.35 mmol/L (normal), ALP 68 U/L (normal)

### Assessment
1. Comprehensive geriatric review — 77-year-old female, functionally independent, cognitively intact, socially engaged; main concerns are progressive left knee OA and age-related fall risk
2. Left knee osteoarthritis — progressive; ROM decreasing; early varus malalignment; TUG increasing; functional limitation developing; orthopedic assessment warranted
3. Atrial fibrillation — stable on warfarin and diltiazem; INR therapeutic
4. Osteopenia — progressing (T-score -2.0 femoral neck, was -1.8); FRAX calculation: 10-year major osteoporotic fracture risk approximately 15-18%, hip fracture risk approximately 4-5%; approaching pharmacological treatment threshold
5. Mild hearing loss — bilateral, high-frequency; mild functional impact
6. CKD stage 2 — stable (eGFR 64)
7. Vitamin D — adequate on supplementation

### Plan
- Left knee OA: Refer to Dr. Anthony Greco, Orthopedics, Kingston Health Sciences Centre, for assessment — progressive symptoms, early varus, TUG increasing, may benefit from injection therapy or discussion of left TKA if conservative measures fail
- Continue topical diclofenac and acetaminophen PRN; avoid oral NSAIDs
- Osteopenia management: FRAX risk approaching treatment threshold; discuss bisphosphonate therapy (alendronate 70 mg weekly) at next visit after orthopedic assessment is planned; want to coordinate with orthopedic opinion. Continue calcium 500 mg + vitamin D 1000 IU daily
- Hearing: Refer for formal audiometry; discuss hearing aid assessment if confirmed moderate loss; hearing loss is an independent risk factor for falls and cognitive decline
- Fall prevention: Continue home exercise program; TUG slightly worse — reinforce balance exercises; consider additional physiotherapy
- Continue warfarin per INR clinic; continue diltiazem ER 120 mg daily
- FIT for colorectal screening: due — requisition provided
- Advance care planning: Initiated discussion; patient has a current power of attorney for personal care (daughter); will address goals of care further at future visit
- Influenza vaccine: will complete in fall 2025; pneumococcal: up to date

### Disposition
- Follow-up: FP in 3 months; INR clinic ongoing
- Referrals: Dr. Anthony Greco (Orthopedics) — left knee OA assessment; Audiology

- Date: 2025-07-15
- Time: 14:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Specialist Clinic
- Organization: Kingston Health Sciences Centre — Orthopedics (76 Stuart St, Kingston, ON K7L 2V7)
- Practitioner: Dr. Anthony Greco, MD FRCSC Orthopedic Surgery (ON-PRAC-78541)
- Reason for visit: Long-term follow-up right TKA (2020); assessment of progressive left knee osteoarthritis

### Subjective
Mrs. Collins presents to the orthopedic clinic, referred by Dr. Whitfield for progressive left knee osteoarthritis. She also has a scheduled long-term follow-up of her right total knee arthroplasty performed in January 2020 by Dr. Greco. Regarding the right knee: she reports it continues to function well — minimal stiffness, no pain, no instability, no swelling. She is satisfied with the outcome. Regarding the left knee: she describes progressive medial knee pain over the past 12-18 months, now rated 5-6/10 most days. The pain is worse with stairs (especially descending), prolonged walking, and rising from a seated position. Morning stiffness lasts 15-20 minutes. She has tried acetaminophen (partial relief), topical diclofenac (helpful but wears off), and completed physiotherapy (helpful for balance but did not significantly improve knee pain). She is managing but notes functional decline — shorter walks, avoiding stairs when possible, relying more on handrails. She asks about injection options and whether she might need another knee replacement. She is on warfarin (INR generally 2.0-3.0) and aware that this complicates any procedural planning. No constitutional symptoms, no night pain, no history of gout.

### Objective
- General: Well-appearing elderly female, mildly antalgic gait favoring left
- Right knee (TKA): Well-healed midline incision, no warmth, no effusion, ROM 0-120 degrees, stable to AP/lateral stress, no crepitus through prosthesis, satisfactory alignment
- Left knee: Moderate medial joint line tenderness, mild cool effusion, ROM 5-110 degrees (loss of full extension and further flexion loss), crepitus throughout range, early fixed varus deformity (~5 degrees), ligaments stable, negative McMurray (though limited by pain), no popliteal mass, no focal warmth
- Neurovascular: Intact distally bilaterally
- Standing alignment: Bilateral varus tendency, more pronounced on left

Imaging reviewed:
- Right knee X-ray (today): TKA components well-fixed, no loosening, no periprosthetic fracture, satisfactory alignment; no concerns
- Left knee X-ray (today, weight-bearing AP/lateral/skyline):
  - Medial compartment: Severe joint space narrowing with subchondral sclerosis and marginal osteophytes; near bone-on-bone contact
  - Lateral compartment: Moderate narrowing with osteophytes
  - Patellofemoral: Moderate narrowing, osteophyte formation
  - Kellgren-Lawrence grade IV (medial compartment)
  - Mild varus angulation

### Assessment
1. Right total knee arthroplasty (2020) — 5 years post-op; clinically and radiographically satisfactory; no evidence of loosening; excellent functional outcome
2. Left knee osteoarthritis — severe (Kellgren-Lawrence grade IV medial compartment); progressive symptoms correlating with radiographic severity; conservative measures partially exhausted; patient is a candidate for left total knee arthroplasty
3. Anticoagulation consideration — warfarin for atrial fibrillation; will require perioperative bridging protocol if surgical intervention planned

### Plan
- Right knee TKA: No further routine orthopedic follow-up needed unless new symptoms arise; patient to return if any concerns (pain, swelling, instability)
- Left knee OA — discussed treatment options in detail:
  - Corticosteroid injection: Offered as a temporizing measure; discussed that she is on warfarin — injection can be performed safely with INR in therapeutic range (2.0-3.0); may provide 4-12 weeks of relief; does not alter disease progression
  - Viscosupplementation (hyaluronic acid injection): Available but evidence is equivocal; not covered by OHIP; patient not interested at this time
  - Total knee arthroplasty (left): Discussed in detail as the definitive treatment option given grade IV disease and progressive functional decline despite conservative measures. Patient is a good surgical candidate based on overall health, functional status, and positive prior TKA experience on the right. Risks discussed include infection (1-2%), thromboembolic events, stiffness, prosthetic complications, perioperative bleeding risk given warfarin. Perioperative anticoagulation management would require coordination with Dr. Whitfield and Dr. Hussain (cardiology) — likely bridging with LMWH perioperatively.
  - Patient's preference: She would like to proceed with a corticosteroid injection today for symptom relief and wishes to consider TKA over the coming months, discussing with her daughter and family physician. She is not opposed to surgery but wants time to plan.
- Performed left knee corticosteroid injection today: 1 mL methylprednisolone 40 mg + 4 mL 1% lidocaine injected into the medial compartment via standard anteromedial approach under sterile technique; no immediate complications; patient tolerated well; INR was 2.3 per recent result (safe range for injection)
- Post-injection: May have increased pain for 24-48 hours; ice and acetaminophen; avoid heavy activity for 48 hours; onset of benefit expected within 3-7 days
- If patient decides to pursue left TKA: Will need pre-operative medical clearance, cardiology input for perioperative anticoagulation plan, and pre-surgical physiotherapy (prehabilitation)
- Consultation note sent to Dr. Whitfield and Dr. Hussain

### Disposition
- Follow-up: Orthopedics in 3-4 months to reassess left knee after injection; sooner if patient decides to pursue surgical booking
- Referrals: None additional; coordination with FP and cardiology as needed for surgical planning

## Encounter 9: 2025-10-07 — FP Visit / INR Review, Medication Review

- Date: 2025-10-07
- Time: 09:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Organization
- Organization: Kingston Family Health Organization (115 Clarence St, Kingston, ON K7L 1X4)
- Practitioner: Dr. James Whitfield, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-67812)
- Reason for visit: INR review; medication review; follow-up on orthopedic assessment and left knee

### Subjective
Mrs. Collins presents for a routine visit. She reports that the corticosteroid injection to her left knee in July provided significant relief for approximately 8 weeks. The pain has gradually returned over the past 4-6 weeks, now back to approximately 4/10 at baseline, 6/10 with stairs. She has been managing with acetaminophen and topical diclofenac. She has discussed left TKA with her daughter and is leaning toward proceeding with surgery, likely in early 2026 to allow for planning. She wants to discuss the anticoagulation management and what would be involved. She had her audiometry completed — results confirm bilateral mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss; hearing aid trial recommended; she is considering it. No falls since July 2024. She completed her FIT (negative result). She received her influenza vaccine in September 2025. No new symptoms. No palpitations, dyspnea, or bleeding. Mood and cognition stable.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 124/70 mmHg, HR 74 bpm (irregularly irregular), SpO2 97% RA
- Weight: 68.0 kg
- General: Well-appearing, no acute distress
- Cardiovascular: Irregularly irregular, rate controlled, no murmurs, no edema
- Left knee: Medial tenderness returned, small effusion, ROM 5-112 degrees, crepitus; no warmth or signs of infection from prior injection
- INR (2025-10-01): 2.4 (therapeutic)
- Labs (2025-09): CBC normal (Hgb 126 g/L), Cr 84 umol/L, eGFR 62, electrolytes normal

Medications reconciliation:
1. Warfarin — variable dose per INR clinic (average ~4.5 mg/day)
2. Diltiazem ER 120 mg daily
3. Calcium 500 mg + vitamin D 1000 IU daily (OTC)
4. Acetaminophen 500 mg TID PRN (regular use)
5. Topical diclofenac gel 1% TID to left knee PRN

### Assessment
1. Left knee osteoarthritis — severe; injection benefit waning; patient considering left TKA
2. Atrial fibrillation — stable on warfarin and diltiazem; INR therapeutic
3. Perioperative anticoagulation planning — will need coordination with cardiology for warfarin bridging if TKA proceeds
4. Bilateral sensorineural hearing loss — mild-to-moderate; audiometry confirmed; hearing aid trial recommended
5. Osteopenia — still below pharmacological threshold by FRAX but progressing; bisphosphonate initiation deferred pending orthopedic surgical planning (would want to start post-operatively if TKA proceeds)
6. CKD stage 2 — stable (eGFR 62)
7. Health maintenance — FIT negative; influenza vaccine done; advance care planning initiated

### Plan
- Left knee TKA planning: Patient wishes to proceed — will contact Dr. Greco's office to request surgical booking for early 2026; likely 3-4 month wait list
- Pre-operative workup to be initiated once surgical date confirmed: CBC, electrolytes, Cr, INR, ECG, chest X-ray, group and screen; medical clearance letter to be prepared
- Contact Dr. Hussain (cardiology) to establish perioperative anticoagulation plan — anticipate: stop warfarin 5 days pre-op, bridge with LMWH (enoxaparin) based on CHADS2-VASc score of 4 (high thromboembolic risk), restart warfarin post-op day 1 with LMWH overlap until INR therapeutic
- Continue all current medications
- Hearing aids: Encouraged patient to proceed with hearing aid trial through audiologist; discussed that hearing loss contributes to social isolation and cognitive decline risk; ADP (Assistive Devices Program) funding may be available through OHIP
- Osteopenia: Defer bisphosphonate until post-surgical period; continue calcium and vitamin D
- Advance care planning: Revisited briefly; patient has POA for personal care (daughter Emily Collins); wishes documented: full resuscitation, open to surgical intervention, no desire for prolonged ICU care if prognosis poor; will formalize in chart
- FIT: Negative result filed; repeat in 2 years

### Disposition
- Follow-up: FP in 4 months (pre-op visit if surgical date confirmed); INR clinic ongoing
- Referrals: Dr. Greco — surgical booking request for left TKA; Dr. Hussain — perioperative anticoagulation plan

- Practitioner: Dr. James Whitfield, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-67812)
- Reason for visit: Annual health review; AF management; pre-operative planning update for left TKA

### Subjective
Mrs. Collins presents for her annual review. She turns 78 in May. She reports that she has been booked for left total knee arthroplasty with Dr. Greco on April 14, 2026, at Kingston Health Sciences Centre. She is anxious but looking forward to the surgery based on her positive experience with the right knee. Her left knee pain is currently 5-6/10 at baseline, limiting her walks to 10-15 minutes, and she has begun using a single-point cane for longer outings. She is managing stairs in her home by leading with the right leg going up and the left going down. She has been doing pre-surgical exercises as instructed by the physiotherapist. She received a hearing aid fitting in December — bilateral behind-the-ear hearing aids — and finds them very helpful, particularly in group settings. No falls since July 2024. She remains independent in ADLs though acknowledges relying more on her daughter for grocery shopping and heavy housework. She drives short distances only (within Cobourg). No cardiac symptoms. No bleeding, bruising, melena. Mood is good; she is optimistic about the surgery. Sleep disrupted some nights by knee pain. Appetite good. She received her COVID booster in January 2026.

She received a letter from Dr. Hussain's office confirming the perioperative anticoagulation bridging plan (discussed below).
