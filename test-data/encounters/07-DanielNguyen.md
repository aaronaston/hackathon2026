## Encounter 2: 2025-01-14 — Acute Gastroenteritis

- Date: 2025-01-14
- Time: 11:20
- Type: Walk-in
- Setting: Walk-in Clinic
- Organization: Dundas Walk-in Clinic (2100 Dundas St W, Toronto, ON)
- Practitioner: Dr. Martin Chou, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-70215)
- Reason for visit: Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea x 2 days

### Subjective

Mr. Nguyen presents to the walk-in clinic with a 2-day history of nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea. Symptoms began abruptly on Sunday morning with nausea and crampy periumbilical abdominal pain, followed by vomiting (3-4 episodes on day one, now 1-2 episodes today). Diarrhea began several hours after the vomiting, described as watery, non-bloody, approximately 6-8 loose stools per day. He reports subjective low-grade fever and chills but did not measure his temperature at home. He has been trying to maintain oral intake with water and diluted juice but has had difficulty keeping fluids down consistently. He ate leftover takeout food (chicken stir-fry) the evening before symptom onset, which he suspects may have been improperly stored. No one else in his household is ill, though he lives alone. He denies any recent travel. No blood in stool or vomit. No rash, joint pains, or urinary symptoms. No recent antibiotic use. No known food allergies. He is not on any regular medications. He notes that his usual family physician is Dr. Brooks at the Halton Hills FHT in Oakville but he came to this clinic because it is closer to his home in Mississauga and had earlier availability.

### Objective

- Vitals: BP 110/68 mmHg, HR 92 bpm, Temp 37.8 C, RR 16, SpO2 99% RA
- General: Mildly unwell-appearing, slightly fatigued, no acute distress
- HEENT: Mucous membranes slightly dry; oropharynx clear
- Cardiovascular: Tachycardic but regular rhythm, S1S2 normal, no murmurs
- Respiratory: Clear bilaterally
- Abdomen: Soft, diffuse mild tenderness greatest in the periumbilical region, no guarding, no rebound, no rigidity; hyperactive bowel sounds; no organomegaly
- Skin: Skin turgor mildly reduced; no rash
- No orthostatic vitals performed (patient not lightheaded on standing)

### Assessment

1. **Acute gastroenteritis** — likely viral or foodborne given the abrupt onset following suspect food exposure. Clinical presentation consistent with self-limited gastroenteritis. No features of inflammatory or invasive diarrhea (no bloody stool, no high fever). Mild dehydration evidenced by dry mucous membranes, mild tachycardia, and reduced skin turgor, but no hemodynamic instability or orthostatic symptoms.
2. No indication for stool cultures at this time given presentation duration <72 hours, no bloody stools, and no features of dysentery. Stool cultures should be considered if symptoms persist beyond 72 hours or worsen.

### Plan

1. Aggressive oral rehydration: oral rehydration solution (ORS) recommended — small frequent sips; available over the counter at pharmacy. Alternatively, diluted juice with soda crackers.
2. BRAT-type diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast) as tolerated; advance to regular diet as symptoms improve. Avoid dairy, caffeine, and high-fat foods until symptoms resolve.
3. Ondansetron 4 mg PO/SL q8h PRN for nausea/vomiting x 3 days — prescription provided (quantity 9 tablets) to help maintain oral intake.
4. Acetaminophen 500 mg PO q4-6h PRN for fever or abdominal discomfort (max 4 g/day).
5. Advised to monitor for signs of worsening dehydration: lightheadedness, decreased urine output, persistent inability to tolerate any oral fluids — present to emergency department if these develop.
6. Return precautions: blood in stool, fever >38.5 C persisting beyond 48 hours, inability to maintain oral hydration, worsening abdominal pain, symptoms not improving after 72 hours.
7. Hand hygiene emphasized to prevent transmission; avoid preparing food for others until 48 hours after symptom resolution.
8. No antibiotics indicated. No stool testing at this time.
9. Advised to follow up with family physician Dr. Brooks if symptoms persist or for any ongoing concerns.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: As needed; return to walk-in or family physician if symptoms persist beyond 72 hours or worsen
- Referrals: None

### Subjective

Daniel returns for his annual physical examination. He reports feeling well with no active concerns. He mentions the episode of acute gastroenteritis in January 2025 for which he attended the Dundas Walk-in Clinic.
