- Reason for visit: Annual health examination and major depressive disorder remission review

### Subjective
Ms. Morrison presents for her annual physical examination and ongoing review of major depressive disorder (MDD), currently in remission. She reports feeling well overall and describes her mood as "good and stable." She has been taking Escitalopram 10 mg daily for approximately two years and feels it has been effective. She denies low mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, guilt, or suicidal ideation. Sleep is regular — she falls asleep within 15–20 minutes, sleeps 7–8 hours nightly, and wakes feeling rested. Appetite is normal and she has not noticed any weight changes. Energy levels are good; she is active in her daily routine and enjoys walking and reading outside of work.

She works full-time as a librarian at the Kingston Frontenac Public Library. She describes her work as fulfilling and manageable. No recent interpersonal stressors. She lives alone in a rented apartment on Brock Street and has a supportive social network including close friends and a sister who lives in Ottawa.

She asks about how long she should continue Escitalopram and whether she will eventually be able to stop.

Medications: Escitalopram 10 mg PO daily.

Allergies: No known drug allergies. No environmental or food allergies.

Social history: Non-smoker. Occasional alcohol (1–2 glasses of wine per week, socially). No recreational drug use. Single, no dependents. Librarian.

Family history: Mother with generalized anxiety disorder. Father with hypertension. No family history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or completed suicide.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 118/72 mmHg, HR 68 bpm, RR 14, Temp 36.5°C, SpO2 99% RA
- Height: 164 cm, Weight: 64.5 kg, BMI: 24.0 kg/m²
- General: Well-appearing, well-groomed, pleasant affect, no psychomotor retardation or agitation
- HEENT: Pupils equal and reactive, oropharynx clear, no thyromegaly
- Cardiovascular: S1 S2 normal, no murmurs, peripheral pulses 2+ bilaterally
- Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly
- Extremities: No edema
- Mental status examination: Alert and oriented ×3. Mood described as "good." Affect euthymic, congruent, full range. Speech normal rate, rhythm, and volume. Thought process linear and goal-directed. No suicidal or homicidal ideation. No perceptual disturbances. Insight and judgment intact.

PHQ-9 score: 2/27 (minimal depression — endorsed "several days" for "feeling tired or having little energy" and "trouble falling or staying asleep"; all other items scored 0).

Lab results (drawn 2024-04-09):
- CBC: within normal limits
- TSH: 2.4 mIU/L (normal)
- Fasting glucose: 4.9 mmol/L
- Creatinine: 62 µmol/L, eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73m²
- ALT: 18 U/L
- Lipid panel: Total cholesterol 4.4 mmol/L, LDL 2.4 mmol/L, HDL 1.6 mmol/L, TG 0.9 mmol/L

Preventive health:
- Cervical screening: Pap test done today
- Breast screening: Not yet indicated per Ontario guidelines (age 41; OBSP begins at 50 unless high-risk)

### Assessment
1. Major depressive disorder — in full remission. PHQ-9 score of 2 is consistent with minimal/no depressive symptoms. Patient has been in remission for approximately 12 months on Escitalopram 10 mg daily. Current episode was her first episode, which responded well to SSRI monotherapy. No residual symptoms on mental status examination.
2. Duration of antidepressant maintenance therapy — per CANMAT 2016 guidelines, maintenance therapy for a minimum of 6–12 months after remission is recommended for a first episode of MDD. Patient has now met this minimum threshold. However, given that her depressive episode was moderately severe and took several months to respond, and that she is tolerating the medication well without significant side effects, a longer maintenance course of at least 2 years from remission is reasonable to reduce relapse risk. Discussed with patient.
3. Health maintenance — routine bloodwork normal. BMI 24.0, within normal range. No cardiovascular risk factors identified. Lipid panel within target.

### Plan
1. Continue Escitalopram 10 mg PO daily. Discussed rationale for continued maintenance therapy — patient understands that premature discontinuation increases relapse risk and agrees to continue for at least another 12 months, with reassessment at that time.
2. Discussed relapse warning signs: persistent low mood, withdrawal from activities, sleep disruption lasting more than 2 weeks, loss of interest in work or social activities. Encouraged patient to reach out promptly if she notices these patterns.
3. Discussed Escitalopram side effects — patient reports no sexual dysfunction, no weight gain, no GI symptoms, no vivid dreams. Tolerating medication well.
4. Continue healthy lifestyle habits — regular physical activity, social engagement, and sleep hygiene.
5. Pap test results to be communicated by telephone.
6. Influenza and COVID-19 vaccines up to date.
7. Requisition provided for repeat TSH and CBC in 12 months (routine monitoring).

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 5–6 months for medication renewal and mood check
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 2: 2024-09-10 — Medication Renewal / PHQ-9 Follow-up

- Date: 2024-09-10
- Time: 14:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Kingston Family Health Organization (115 Clarence St, Kingston, ON)
- Practitioner: Dr. James Whitfield, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-67812)
- Reason for visit: Escitalopram prescription renewal and depression remission monitoring

### Subjective
Ms. Morrison presents for a scheduled follow-up for Escitalopram renewal and mood check. She reports continued stable mood. She describes feeling "like myself" and states she is engaged in her work, social life, and hobbies. Sleep remains 7–8 hours nightly without difficulty falling or staying asleep. Appetite is normal. Energy levels are good. She has been reading more in the evenings and recently joined a community book club, which she finds enjoyable.

She denies low mood, anhedonia, irritability, anxiety, crying spells, difficulty concentrating, hopelessness, or suicidal ideation. No side effects from Escitalopram. She mentions she has been experiencing some mild dry mouth over the past few months that she attributes to the medication but says it is not bothersome — she manages it by drinking more water throughout the day.

No new stressors. Work is going well. She visited her sister in Ottawa over the August long weekend and felt it was a good trip.

No new medications, supplements, or health concerns.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 116/70 mmHg, HR 66 bpm
- Weight: 64.8 kg, BMI: 24.1 kg/m²
- General: Well-appearing, euthymic affect, engaged in conversation
- Mental status examination: Alert and oriented. Mood "good." Affect bright, congruent. Speech and thought process normal. No suicidal ideation. Insight and judgment intact.

PHQ-9 score: 1/27 (minimal depression — endorsed "several days" for "feeling tired or having little energy" only).

### Assessment
1. Major depressive disorder — in sustained full remission. PHQ-9 score of 1, improved from 2 in April 2024. No depressive symptoms on clinical interview or mental status examination. Patient now approximately 18 months in remission on Escitalopram 10 mg daily.
2. Escitalopram tolerability — mild xerostomia (dry mouth) reported, which is a recognized SSRI side effect. Patient is managing with increased fluid intake and it is not affecting quality of life or medication adherence. No other side effects.
3. Weight — stable at 64.8 kg (BMI 24.1), no SSRI-associated weight gain.

### Plan
1. Renew Escitalopram 10 mg PO daily — prescription renewed for 6 months with 1 refill (total 12-month supply).
2. Continue current maintenance course. Plan to reassess duration of therapy at the next annual physical (target April 2025). At that point, patient will have been in remission for approximately 2 years, and a discussion about potential gradual taper can be revisited.
3. Discussed dry mouth management: continue increased fluid intake, sugar-free gum or lozenges if needed, maintain regular dental visits. If worsens, can consider dose adjustment, though this is not indicated currently.
4. Reinforced relapse prevention strategies: maintain regular sleep schedule, physical activity, social connections, and early help-seeking if mood changes.
5. No bloodwork required at this visit — next routine labs at annual physical.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 5–6 months at annual physical (target April 2025), or sooner if concerns arise
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 3: 2025-02-04 — Stress at Work / Relapse Concern

- Date: 2025-02-04
- Time: 11:15
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Kingston Family Health Organization (115 Clarence St, Kingston, ON)
- Practitioner: Dr. James Whitfield, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-67812)
- Reason for visit: Self-referred for mood concern — increased stress at work, worried about possible depressive relapse

### Subjective
Ms. Morrison presents with a concern about her mood over the past 3–4 weeks. She reports that her workplace has been undergoing a significant restructuring — two colleagues were laid off in January and her workload has substantially increased. She has been working longer hours and has had difficulty "switching off" in the evenings. She describes feeling more irritable than usual, particularly at home in the evenings, and notes that she has been less interested in her book club and has skipped the last two meetings. She also reports difficulty falling asleep, lying awake for 30–45 minutes most nights thinking about work tasks, compared to her usual 15–20 minutes. Appetite is mildly decreased — she has been "not bothering" to cook proper meals some evenings and eating cereal or toast instead.

However, she is clear that her mood is "not like it was before" when she was in her depressive episode. She does not feel persistently sad or hopeless. She is still able to enjoy activities when she does engage in them — she watched a film with a friend last weekend and laughed and felt present. She denies crying spells, feelings of worthlessness, guilt, difficulty concentrating at work, psychomotor changes, or suicidal ideation. She came in proactively because she is vigilant about early warning signs, as discussed at previous visits, and she is worried this could be the beginning of a relapse.

She continues to take Escitalopram 10 mg daily without missed doses. No new medications or substances. Alcohol intake unchanged at 1–2 drinks per week socially.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 122/76 mmHg, HR 72 bpm
- Weight: 63.8 kg, BMI: 23.7 kg/m² (down 1.0 kg from September 2024)
- General: Appears slightly tired. Well-groomed. Makes good eye contact.
- Mental status examination: Alert and oriented ×3. Mood described as "stressed and a bit off." Affect mildly anxious but reactive and appropriate — she smiled when discussing her friend visit. Speech normal. Thought process linear and goal-directed. No suicidal or homicidal ideation. No perceptual disturbances. Insight excellent — she is self-monitoring and appropriately seeking help. Judgment intact.

PHQ-9 score: 7/27 (mild depression — endorsed items: "little interest or pleasure in doing things" several days [1], "trouble falling or staying asleep" more than half the days [2], "feeling tired or having little energy" more than half the days [2], "poor appetite or overeating" several days [1], "feeling bad about yourself" several days [1]).

### Assessment
1. Adjustment reaction with mild depressive symptoms in the context of workplace stress — PHQ-9 has risen from 1 to 7, which represents a clinically meaningful change but remains in the mild range. Symptoms are clearly temporally linked to an identifiable psychosocial stressor (workplace restructuring and increased workload). Patient does not meet criteria for a major depressive episode — she retains capacity for enjoyment, denies persistent sadness or hopelessness, and has no functional impairment at work. However, the symptom trajectory warrants close monitoring given her history of MDD.
2. Major depressive disorder — currently in remission but at risk for relapse given the stress-related prodromal symptoms. The PHQ-9 score of 7 is above her baseline of 1–2, and the pattern of sleep disruption, reduced interest in pleasurable activities, and appetite change overlaps with her prior depressive episode features.
3. Weight — mild decrease (1.0 kg) likely related to reduced food intake during period of stress. Not clinically concerning at this time.

### Plan
1. Continue Escitalopram 10 mg PO daily — no dose change at this time. Current symptoms are mild and clearly stress-related. Increasing the dose is not indicated unless symptoms worsen or persist beyond 4–6 weeks despite non-pharmacologic interventions.
2. Discussed behavioural activation strategies: schedule pleasurable activities (return to book club, social outings) even when motivation is low; maintain regular meal times and balanced nutrition; limit work-related screen time after 8 PM.
3. Sleep hygiene reinforcement: consistent bedtime routine, limit caffeine after 2 PM, avoid screens in bed, consider relaxation techniques (progressive muscle relaxation, guided breathing) if mind is racing at bedtime.
4. Discussed workplace stress management: encouraged patient to speak with her supervisor about workload concerns, and to set boundaries around overtime hours. Provided information on the Ontario Employee Assistance Program resources available through her employer.
5. Counselling referral offered — discussed short-term cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) through the Kingston FHO's social worker for stress management and relapse prevention. Patient is interested and agrees to a referral.
6. Provided patient with a mood diary template — asked her to track mood, sleep, appetite, and energy daily for the next 4 weeks and bring it to the next visit.
7. Safety discussion: reviewed when to seek urgent help (persistent suicidal thoughts, inability to function at work or home, worsening despite interventions). Patient verbalizes understanding. Crisis resources reviewed: Kingston crisis line and local emergency department.
8. Close follow-up scheduled in 4 weeks to reassess symptoms, review mood diary, and determine whether medication adjustment or psychiatric referral is needed.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 4 weeks (target early March 2025) for close mood reassessment
- Referrals: Kingston FHO social worker for brief CBT / stress management

## Encounter 4: 2025-06-17 — Annual Physical / Mood Review

- Date: 2025-06-17
- Time: 09:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Kingston Family Health Organization (115 Clarence St, Kingston, ON)
- Practitioner: Dr. James Whitfield, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-67812)
- Reason for visit: Annual health examination and comprehensive mood review following winter stress episode

### Subjective
Ms. Morrison presents for her annual physical examination. She reports that her mood has returned to her baseline since the stress episode in early 2025. She attended four sessions with the FHO social worker between March and April 2025, focusing on cognitive behavioural strategies for workplace stress and relapse prevention. She found the sessions helpful — she developed a structured "stress response plan" that includes recognizing early warning signs and implementing specific coping strategies before symptoms escalate. The workplace situation stabilized by mid-March when a new part-time colleague was hired to share the workload.

She reports her sleep is back to normal — falling asleep within 15–20 minutes, sleeping 7–8 hours nightly. Appetite has normalized and she has resumed regular cooking. She returned to her book club in March and has been attending consistently. Energy levels are good. Mood is described as "back to normal — solid." She denies low mood, anhedonia, irritability, anxiety, or any residual stress-related symptoms.

She continues to take Escitalopram 10 mg daily. She raises the question of tapering off the medication, noting she has now been in remission for approximately 2 years (since mid-2023) and feels stable.

No new health concerns. No new medications or supplements. No allergies.

Social history update: She started dating someone in May — describes the relationship as positive and supportive. Continues to work full-time as a librarian. Visited her sister in Ottawa over the Victoria Day weekend.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 116/70 mmHg, HR 66 bpm, RR 14, Temp 36.5°C, SpO2 99% RA
- Height: 164 cm, Weight: 64.2 kg, BMI: 23.9 kg/m²
- General: Well-appearing, well-groomed, bright and engaged affect
- HEENT: Normal. No thyromegaly
- Cardiovascular: S1 S2 normal, no murmurs
- Respiratory: Clear bilaterally
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly
- Extremities: No edema
- Mental status examination: Alert and oriented ×3. Mood "good, back to myself." Affect euthymic, full range, congruent. Speech normal. Thought process linear. No suicidal or homicidal ideation. Insight and judgment intact.

PHQ-9 score: 2/27 (minimal depression — endorsed "several days" for "feeling tired or having little energy" and "trouble falling or staying asleep"; returned to her April 2024 baseline).

Lab results (drawn 2025-06-10):
- CBC: within normal limits
- TSH: 2.2 mIU/L (normal)
- Fasting glucose: 5.0 mmol/L
- Creatinine: 63 µmol/L, eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73m²
- ALT: 16 U/L
- Lipid panel: Total cholesterol 4.3 mmol/L, LDL 2.3 mmol/L, HDL 1.6 mmol/L, TG 0.8 mmol/L

Preventive health:
- Cervical screening: Up to date (Pap April 2024, results normal)
- Breast screening: Not yet indicated per Ontario guidelines (age 41)

### Assessment
1. Major depressive disorder — in sustained full remission. PHQ-9 score of 2, returned to baseline. The stress-related symptom exacerbation in February 2025 resolved with brief CBT, workplace stress reduction, and continued antidepressant therapy. No dose change was required. This episode reinforces the value of ongoing maintenance therapy and the patient's excellent self-monitoring.
2. Escitalopram tapering discussion — patient has been in remission for approximately 2 years on Escitalopram 10 mg. Per CANMAT guidelines, for a first episode of MDD, 2 years of maintenance therapy after remission is a reasonable minimum. She is now at this threshold. However, the recent stress-related symptom flare (PHQ-9 rose to 7 in February 2025) suggests some ongoing vulnerability, and the flare occurred despite being on maintenance therapy. Discussed with patient: tapering is a reasonable option, but given the recent near-relapse, continuing for an additional 6–12 months to ensure sustained stability through potential future stressors would be prudent. Patient agrees with this rationale.
3. Health maintenance — routine bloodwork normal. BMI 23.9, weight stable. Lipid panel within target. TSH normal. No cardiovascular risk factors.
4. Weight — 64.2 kg, stable and within healthy range. No SSRI-associated weight gain over the treatment period.

### Plan
1. Continue Escitalopram 10 mg PO daily for an additional 6–12 months. Target reassessment for tapering discussion at next medication renewal visit (approximately December 2025).
2. When tapering is pursued, plan for gradual dose reduction: Escitalopram 10 mg → 5 mg daily for 4 weeks → 5 mg every other day for 2 weeks → discontinuation, with close monitoring throughout. Discussed SSRI discontinuation syndrome (dizziness, nausea, irritability, "brain zaps," insomnia) and the importance of not stopping abruptly.
3. Continue cognitive behavioural strategies learned in therapy sessions. Patient has a written stress response plan and knows to return promptly if early warning signs emerge.
4. Maintain healthy lifestyle: regular sleep, physical activity, social engagement, balanced nutrition.
5. No referral to psychiatry indicated at this time — MDD in remission, single episode, responding to primary care management.
6. Pap test not due until 2027 (3-year interval per Ontario guidelines, last done April 2024).
7. Influenza vaccine to be administered in the fall.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 6 months for medication renewal and tapering reassessment (target December 2025)
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 5: 2025-12-09 — Medication Renewal / Stable Mood

- Date: 2025-12-09
- Time: 15:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Kingston Family Health Organization (115 Clarence St, Kingston, ON)
- Practitioner: Dr. James Whitfield, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-67812)
- Reason for visit: Escitalopram prescription renewal and tapering reassessment

### Subjective
Ms. Morrison presents for her scheduled medication renewal and follow-up. She reports continued stable mood over the past 6 months. She describes feeling well and notes that the fall and early winter have been uneventful from a mental health perspective — she was previously concerned about seasonal mood changes, but she has noticed no pattern of worsening in the darker months.

She continues to take Escitalopram 10 mg daily. She denies any depressive symptoms: no low mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, guilt, difficulty concentrating, or suicidal ideation. Sleep is regular at 7–8 hours nightly. Appetite is normal. Energy is good. She has been staying active with indoor walking on a treadmill at the local community centre and continuing her book club. Her relationship is going well and she describes it as a source of support.

Work has been stable since the restructuring resolved. She has continued to apply the CBT strategies she learned and finds them useful for day-to-day stress management.

She raises the topic of Escitalopram tapering again. She feels ready to try coming off the medication but is also somewhat anxious about what that might feel like. She asks about the timeline and what to expect.

No new health concerns. Mild dry mouth persists but is manageable with water intake. No other medication side effects. No new medications, supplements, or allergies.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 118/74 mmHg, HR 70 bpm
- Weight: 64.6 kg, BMI: 24.0 kg/m²
- General: Well-appearing, euthymic, relaxed posture, good eye contact
- Mental status examination: Alert and oriented. Mood "good — feeling like I've been on a good stretch." Affect bright, full range, congruent. Speech normal. Thought process linear. No suicidal ideation. Insight excellent. Judgment intact.

PHQ-9 score: 1/27 (minimal depression — endorsed "several days" for "feeling tired or having little energy" only). This is her lowest recorded score.

### Assessment
1. Major depressive disorder — in sustained full remission. PHQ-9 score of 1, the lowest in her documented monitoring history. Patient has been in remission for approximately 2.5 years. She has now completed over 2 years of maintenance Escitalopram therapy after remission from a first episode of MDD. She has demonstrated resilience through a significant stress-related exacerbation (February 2025) and recovered without dose adjustment. She has acquired CBT-based coping skills, maintains a strong social support network, and demonstrates excellent self-monitoring capacity.
2. Escitalopram tapering — patient meets criteria for a trial of gradual discontinuation per CANMAT guidelines. She is motivated, psychologically prepared, has protective factors in place (social support, coping strategies, stable employment, awareness of early warning signs), and has a low PHQ-9 score. Tapering should occur gradually to minimize discontinuation symptoms and allow for relapse monitoring. Recommended timing: begin taper in spring 2026 (April–May) to avoid initiating discontinuation during winter months, when some patients experience seasonal mood vulnerability.
3. Weight — stable at 64.6 kg, BMI 24.0. No SSRI-associated weight gain throughout treatment course.
4. Dry mouth — stable, mild, managed conservatively. Expected to resolve with medication discontinuation.

### Plan
1. Renew Escitalopram 10 mg PO daily — prescription renewed for 6 months to cover the period through the planned taper.
2. Tapering plan discussed and agreed upon:
   - Continue Escitalopram 10 mg daily through March 2026.
   - April 2026: reduce to 5 mg daily for 4 weeks.
   - May 2026: reduce to 5 mg every other day for 2 weeks, then discontinue.
   - Schedule follow-up visits at 2 weeks and 6 weeks after complete discontinuation to monitor for relapse or discontinuation symptoms.
3. Discussed SSRI discontinuation syndrome in detail: may experience dizziness, nausea, headache, irritability, insomnia, paresthesias ("brain zaps"), vivid dreams. Symptoms are typically mild and self-limited (1–2 weeks) with gradual tapering. If symptoms are severe or persistent, may need to slow the taper or temporarily resume a lower dose.
4. Discussed relapse risk: approximately 40–50% of patients with a first episode of MDD will experience recurrence. Early warning signs reviewed again. Patient to resume mood diary during the taper period and for 3 months after discontinuation.
5. Reinforced that Escitalopram can be restarted at any time if needed — there is no penalty for restarting and re-trialing is typically effective.
6. Safety net: if significant depressive symptoms emerge during or after taper (PHQ-9 > 10, functional impairment, suicidal ideation), patient to contact the office promptly. Psychiatric referral to Dr. Susan Park at Lakeridge Health — Psychiatry (ON-PRAC-77963) is available if relapse occurs and requires specialist management, though this is not anticipated.
7. Influenza vaccine administered today. COVID-19 booster discussed — patient to schedule at pharmacy.
8. Next routine bloodwork at annual physical (target June 2026).

### Disposition
- Follow-up: April 2026 to initiate taper, then close monitoring visits during and after discontinuation
- Referrals: None at this time (psychiatry referral pathway identified as contingency)
