## Encounter 1: 2024-04-11 — Well-Child Visit / Asthma Review / Immunizations

- Date: 2024-04-11
- Time: 10:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Guelph Family Health Team (83 Dawson Rd, Guelph, ON)
- Practitioner: Dr. Sarah Mitchell, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-60215)
- Reason for visit: Well-child assessment (age 3.5 years), asthma review, and routine immunizations

### Subjective

Lucas McLeod is a 3-year-old male (DOB 2020-09-04) brought in by his mother, Jennifer McLeod, for a scheduled well-child visit. Mother reports Lucas has been doing well overall. He attends a home daycare four days per week and his mother describes him as active and social. He is eating a varied diet, though remains a selective eater with some vegetables. He sleeps approximately 11 hours overnight with a 1-hour afternoon nap most days. He is toilet-trained during the day with occasional nighttime accidents; this is considered age-appropriate.

Regarding his asthma, mother reports he has had two episodes of wheeze and cough in the past six months, both associated with upper respiratory tract infections. She administered salbutamol via MDI with AeroChamber and mask during each episode, typically 2 puffs every 4 hours for 2-3 days. Symptoms resolved within 3-4 days each time. No emergency department visits. No night-time awakenings from cough between episodes. No exercise limitation. He has not required salbutamol for the past 5 weeks. No exposure to cigarette smoke in the home or vehicle. No pets. Home is well-maintained; no visible mould or dampness.

Regarding his peanut allergy, mother reports Lucas was diagnosed at age 14 months after developing generalized hives within 15 minutes of eating a peanut butter cracker. He was assessed in the ED at that time and treated with diphenhydramine. Subsequent skin prick testing confirmed peanut sensitization (wheal 8 mm). He carries an EpiPen Jr (epinephrine auto-injector 0.15 mg) at all times; one is kept at the daycare and one in the diaper bag. No accidental exposures since diagnosis. Mother and daycare providers have been trained in EpiPen Jr administration. No other food allergies identified. He tolerates tree nuts without issue.

Developmental history per mother: speaking in 3-4 word sentences, can follow two-step commands, names colours and some letters, counts to 5, runs and climbs well, pedals a tricycle, draws circles and attempts to copy lines, plays cooperatively with other children at daycare, shows imaginative play (pretend cooking, playing with toy animals). No behavioural concerns. No aggression or tantrums beyond what is typical for age. No parental concerns about hearing or vision.

Immunization history: up to date per Ontario publicly funded schedule through 18 months. Due today for DTaP-IPV (4th dose) and MMR (2nd dose) per the Ontario schedule at age 4 (administered early at 3.5 years, which is acceptable as minimum interval has been met). Received influenza vaccine in October 2023.

Family history: father has seasonal allergic rhinitis. Maternal grandmother has asthma. No family history of anaphylaxis. Parents are both healthy. Lucas lives with both parents at 18 Parkside Dr, Guelph. No siblings.

### Assessment

1. **Well-child visit, age 3.5 years** — growth and development appropriate for age. All Rourke Baby Record milestones met. No concerns identified by parent or on clinical assessment. Growth tracking along the 50th-75th percentile corridor.
2. **Mild intermittent asthma** — well controlled. Symptoms occur fewer than 2 days per week on average, no night-time awakenings between episodes, no limitation of activity. Using SART (salbutamol as reliever therapy) PRN only. Meets criteria for well-controlled intermittent asthma per Canadian Thoracic Society guidelines. No need for daily controller therapy at this time.
3. **Peanut allergy (IgE-mediated)** — appropriately managed with strict avoidance and EpiPen Jr availability. No accidental exposures in the past year. Emergency action plan in place at daycare.
4. **Immunizations** — administered today: DTaP-IPV (4th dose, Infanrix-IPV) and MMR (2nd dose, Priorix). Minimum intervals met per Ontario publicly funded immunization schedule.

### Plan

1. Continue salbutamol (Ventolin) HFA 100 mcg/puff MDI via AeroChamber with mask, 2 puffs every 4 hours PRN for wheeze or cough associated with respiratory infections. May increase to 2 puffs every 4 hours regularly during acute episodes for up to 48 hours; if no improvement or worsening, seek medical attention.
2. Asthma action plan reviewed and updated with mother. Green zone (well): no daily medications. Yellow zone (getting worse): salbutamol 2 puffs q4h, contact clinic if using >6 times in 24 hours or for >48 hours. Red zone (emergency): salbutamol 2 puffs q4h or more frequently, seek emergency care immediately if severe distress, inability to speak, or cyanosis.
3. Reviewed AeroChamber technique with mother using demonstration device — technique is good. Discussed that mask can likely be transitioned to mouthpiece around age 4-5 when Lucas can form a seal and coordinate breathing.
4. Peanut allergy: continue strict peanut avoidance. EpiPen Jr 0.15 mg auto-injector — confirmed two devices on hand (one at daycare, one with family), both within expiry. Reviewed anaphylaxis emergency plan: administer EpiPen Jr and call 911 if signs of anaphylaxis (difficulty breathing, throat tightness, vomiting, widespread hives, loss of consciousness). Provided updated allergy action plan letter for daycare.
5. Immunizations administered today in left deltoid (DTaP-IPV) and right deltoid (MMR). Observed in clinic for 15 minutes post-vaccination with no adverse reaction. Discussed expected side effects: local soreness, possible low-grade fever, mild rash 7-10 days post-MMR. Acetaminophen for discomfort if needed.
6. Anticipatory guidance: continue reading daily, limit screen time to <1 hour/day of high-quality content, supervised outdoor play, car seat use (forward-facing with harness), water safety, poison control number reviewed, dental hygiene (brushing 2x/day with fluoride toothpaste pea-sized amount, dental visit every 6 months).
7. Diet counselling: continue offering variety, avoid force-feeding; selective eating at this age is normal. Ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D through milk (500 mL/day) or equivalent. Vitamin D supplementation of 400 IU daily recommended during fall/winter months.
8. Influenza vaccine to be given in October 2024 when available.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: 12 months for next well-child visit (approximately age 4.5), or sooner if asthma worsens or any acute concerns
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 2: 2024-11-18 — Croup / Viral Upper Respiratory Illness

- Date: 2024-11-18
- Time: 18:45
- Type: Walk-in
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Guelph Family Health Team (83 Dawson Rd, Guelph, ON)
- Practitioner: Dr. Sarah Mitchell, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-60215)
- Reason for visit: Barky cough and noisy breathing x 1 day

### Subjective

Lucas is brought in by his father, Mark McLeod, for evaluation of a barky cough that started this morning. Father reports Lucas developed mild rhinorrhea and nasal congestion two days ago. Last night he had a low-grade fever of 37.9 C measured with a temporal thermometer. This morning, he woke with a harsh, seal-like barking cough and his breathing sounded noisy, described by father as a "squeaky sound when breathing in." The stridor was most notable when Lucas was crying or upset and seemed to settle somewhat when he calmed down. Father took Lucas outside into the cool November air for about 10 minutes, which appeared to improve symptoms temporarily. Lucas has been drinking fluids reasonably well, though appetite is reduced. He had two wet diapers (still uses pull-ups at night) and voided normally during the day. No vomiting or diarrhea. No rash. Father did not administer salbutamol as the cough sounded different from Lucas's usual asthma cough and there was no wheeze. He gave acetaminophen (160 mg, children's suspension) at noon today for the fever with some improvement.

No known sick contacts at daycare, though father mentions "a lot of kids have colds." No recent travel. No choking episode or foreign body concern. No history of croup previously. Lucas's asthma has been well-controlled; last salbutamol use was 3 weeks ago during a mild cold for one day only. EpiPen Jr is in the diaper bag; no concerns about peanut exposure.

### Objective

- Vitals: HR 118 bpm, RR 28, Temp 38.1 C (tympanic), SpO2 97% RA
- Weight: 15.8 kg
- General: Alert, mildly fussy but consolable. Sitting on father's lap. Barky cough noted x2 during examination. Mild inspiratory stridor at rest, which worsens transiently with crying.
- HEENT: Nasal congestion with clear rhinorrhea. Oropharynx mildly erythematous, no tonsillar enlargement, no exudates, no drooling. Ears — tympanic membranes normal bilaterally. No periorbital edema.
- Neck: Supple, no meningismus. Mild bilateral anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, small, mobile, non-tender.
- Respiratory: Mild inspiratory stridor at rest. No significant intercostal or substernal retractions at rest. Mild subcostal indrawing when coughing. Air entry fair bilaterally. No expiratory wheeze. No crackles.
- Cardiovascular: Tachycardic (consistent with fever), regular rhythm, no murmurs.
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender.
- Skin: Warm, well-perfused, capillary refill <2 seconds. No rash.

Westley Croup Score: 3 (mild stridor at rest = 1, mild retractions = 1, no cyanosis = 0, normal air entry = 0, no significant altered consciousness = 0, barky cough present). This represents mild-to-moderate croup.

### Assessment

1. **Acute laryngotracheitis (croup)** — mild to moderate severity. Clinical presentation is classic for viral croup: prodromal URI symptoms, barky cough, inspiratory stridor, low-grade fever in a child aged 3-5. Most likely parainfluenza virus. Westley Croup Score of 3. Maintaining adequate oxygenation. No signs of impending respiratory failure or severe obstruction.
2. **Mild intermittent asthma** — not currently exacerbated. No expiratory wheeze on examination. The current presentation is upper airway (stridor) rather than lower airway (wheeze). Salbutamol is not indicated for croup.

### Plan

1. **Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg PO x 1 dose** — administered in clinic: 9.5 mg (0.6 mg/kg x 15.8 kg) given as oral solution. Single dose is standard treatment for croup; reduces airway edema and decreases severity and duration of symptoms. Onset of action 2-4 hours, peak effect at 6 hours, duration up to 36-72 hours. No additional doses typically required.
2. Observed in clinic for 30 minutes post-dexamethasone. Lucas settled with distraction (tablet with cartoon). Stridor at rest decreased. Barky cough persisted but less frequent. SpO2 remained 97-98%. No worsening retractions. Tolerating sips of apple juice.
3. **Supportive care instructions provided to father:**
   - Cool mist humidifier in bedroom overnight may provide comfort (evidence is limited but not harmful).
   - Cool night air exposure can help temporarily reduce stridor.
   - Keep Lucas calm — crying and agitation worsen stridor. Comfort measures, quiet activities.
   - Acetaminophen (160 mg PO q4-6h PRN) or ibuprofen (children's, 100 mg PO q6-8h PRN with food) for fever and discomfort.
   - Ensure adequate oral fluid intake — offer small frequent sips of preferred fluids.
   - Elevate head of bed slightly.
4. **Return to ED or call 911 if:** stridor at rest that does not improve with calm positioning, worsening retractions or increased work of breathing, drooling or inability to swallow, cyanosis or pallor, high fever (>39 C) unresponsive to antipyretics, decreased level of consciousness or unusual drowsiness, inability to drink fluids.
5. Salbutamol NOT indicated for croup (upper airway obstruction). However, if father notices expiratory wheeze (lower airway) in addition to stridor, he may administer salbutamol 2 puffs via AeroChamber per asthma action plan and contact the clinic.
6. Croup symptoms typically peak on days 2-3 and resolve over 5-7 days. The barky cough may persist for several more days. Father counselled that croup is often worse at night.
7. Influenza vaccine: Lucas had not yet received his influenza vaccine for the 2024-2025 season. Deferred today due to acute illness. To be rescheduled when well, ideally within 2-3 weeks.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: Reassess in 24-48 hours if symptoms not improving, or sooner if worsening per return precautions above. Otherwise, return to clinic for influenza vaccine when recovered.
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 3: 2025-05-22 — Well-Child Visit / Asthma Action Plan Update

- Date: 2025-05-22
- Time: 09:15
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Guelph Family Health Team (83 Dawson Rd, Guelph, ON)
- Practitioner: Dr. Sarah Mitchell, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-60215)
- Reason for visit: Well-child assessment (age 4 years, 8 months), asthma action plan review, peanut allergy review

### Subjective

Lucas is brought in by his mother, Jennifer McLeod, for his scheduled well-child visit. Mother reports Lucas is doing well overall. He continues to attend a home daycare and will be starting junior kindergarten (JK) in September 2025. He is eating well with an expanded palate compared to last year; he now eats most vegetables when offered alongside preferred foods. He sleeps approximately 10.5-11 hours overnight and has dropped his daytime nap. He is fully toilet-trained day and night.

Regarding asthma, mother reports Lucas had three episodes of cough and wheeze over the past year, all associated with respiratory infections. The croup episode in November 2024 was the most significant illness. Following that, he had a mild cold in January 2025 with 2 days of intermittent wheeze managed with salbutamol 2 puffs q4h PRN, resolving quickly. A third mild episode occurred in March 2025 during another URI, lasting approximately 2 days. He has not needed salbutamol in 8 weeks. No night-time cough or awakenings. No exercise limitation — he runs, climbs, and rides his tricycle and balance bike without difficulty. No symptoms triggered by cold air, laughing, or crying outside of infections. Mother rates his asthma as well-controlled. She is comfortable using the AeroChamber and feels confident recognizing when to seek medical attention.

Peanut allergy: no accidental exposures. EpiPen Jr devices are current; one at daycare, one with family. Mother is aware that she will need to provide the school with an anaphylaxis emergency plan and updated EpiPen Jr for September JK entry, per Sabrina's Law (Ontario). She would like a new allergy action plan letter for the school.

Lucas received his influenza vaccine in early December 2024 (delayed from the croup episode). He has had no other immunizations since the DTaP-IPV and MMR given in April 2024.

Developmental history: mother reports Lucas is speaking in full sentences (5-6 words), tells simple stories, knows first and last name, counts to 10, recognizes several letters, draws a person with 3-4 body parts, can cut with child-safe scissors, dresses and undresses with minimal help, plays cooperatively with peers, takes turns and shares (most of the time), has an imaginary friend. No behavioural concerns. No regression in any domain. No concerns about hearing or vision. No significant fears or anxieties.

Family and social history unchanged. Lucas lives with both parents at 18 Parkside Dr, Guelph. No siblings. No smoke exposure. No recent travel.

### Assessment

1. **Well-child visit, age 4 years 8 months** — growth and development appropriate for age. All developmental milestones met. Growth tracking steadily along the 50th-75th percentile corridor. Vision and hearing screening within normal limits.
2. **Mild intermittent asthma** — continues to be well controlled on PRN salbutamol only. Approximately 3 episodes per year, all viral-triggered, self-limited, no ED visits, no night-time symptoms between episodes, no activity limitation. Does not meet criteria for step-up to daily controller therapy per Canadian Thoracic Society paediatric guidelines. Asthma action plan to be updated for school entry.
3. **Peanut allergy (IgE-mediated)** — appropriately managed. No accidental exposures. EpiPen Jr available and current. Sabrina's Law documentation needed for school entry in September.
4. **Immunizations** — up to date. No vaccines due today. Next scheduled: influenza vaccine in October 2025. Varicella (2nd dose) is due at 4-6 years per Ontario schedule — can be given today or at next visit. Mother prefers to schedule a separate visit for vaccine only so Lucas "has a positive visit today."

### Plan

1. **Asthma management** — continue current approach. Salbutamol HFA 100 mcg/puff via AeroChamber, 2 puffs q4h PRN for wheeze or cough with colds. Discussed transitioning from mask to mouthpiece on AeroChamber — Lucas demonstrated ability to form a seal around the mouthpiece during today's visit. Mother will practice at home and transition fully over the next few weeks.
2. Updated written asthma action plan provided to mother. Copy to be provided to JK school in September along with salbutamol inhaler and AeroChamber. School action plan includes green/yellow/red zones, emergency contact information, and physician signature.
3. **Peanut allergy action plan** — updated letter provided for school registration, per Sabrina's Law requirements. Letter includes: diagnosis, allergen (peanut), symptoms of anaphylaxis, EpiPen Jr 0.15 mg instructions, emergency protocol (administer EpiPen Jr, call 911, position supine, transport to hospital). Mother to provide school with two EpiPen Jr devices (one for classroom, one for office/gym) and ensure staff training before September.
4. EpiPen Jr 0.15 mg prescription renewed — two auto-injectors. Reviewed expiry dates: current devices expire August 2025. New prescription to be filled before school start. Reviewed administration technique with mother using trainer device. Discussed that EpiPen Jr dose (0.15 mg) remains appropriate for Lucas's weight (18 kg); will reassess dose at next visit as he approaches the 25 kg threshold for EpiPen 0.3 mg transition (typically around age 5-6).
5. **Varicella vaccine (2nd dose)** — to be scheduled as a separate visit. Mother will book appointment in coming weeks. Informed that this should be completed before school entry in September 2025.
6. Anticipatory guidance for school readiness: reviewed separation from parents (brief visits to school before September), establishing a morning routine, practicing self-care skills (coat, shoes, lunch containers), social skills and conflict resolution, consistent bedtime of 7:30-8:00 PM to ensure adequate sleep for a school schedule.
7. General safety: bicycle helmet use, booster seat in car (Lucas meets criteria for forward-facing car seat with harness given weight; transition to booster when ≥18 kg AND maturity to sit properly — may transition soon), water safety, sun protection.
8. Nutrition: continue balanced diet with adequate calcium (500 mL milk/day or equivalent dairy). Vitamin D 400 IU daily during fall/winter. Encourage 2 servings of fruit and 3 servings of vegetables daily.
9. Screen time: limit to 1 hour/day of quality programming; co-view when possible.

### Disposition

## Encounter 4: 2026-01-15 — Annual Visit / Kindergarten Update / Asthma Review

- Date: 2026-01-15
- Time: 10:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Guelph Family Health Team (83 Dawson Rd, Guelph, ON)
- Practitioner: Dr. Sarah Mitchell, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-60215)
- Reason for visit: Annual well-child assessment (age 5 years, 4 months), kindergarten update, asthma review, immunization review

### Subjective

Lucas is brought in by both parents, Jennifer and Mark McLeod, for his annual well-child visit. He started junior kindergarten (JK) in September 2025 and parents report the transition has gone well. Lucas enjoys school, has made several friends, and his teacher reports he is progressing well socially and academically. He participates in gym class and outdoor recess without respiratory limitations. He can write his first name, recognizes most letters and their sounds, counts to 20, and is beginning to read simple sight words. He follows classroom routines and instructions well. Teacher has not raised any behavioural or learning concerns.

Regarding asthma, parents report Lucas had two mild episodes since his last visit, both associated with upper respiratory infections — one in October 2025 and one in early January 2026. Each episode involved intermittent cough and mild wheeze lasting 2-3 days, managed at home with salbutamol 2 puffs q4h PRN via AeroChamber with mouthpiece (successfully transitioned from mask). He did not miss any school days for asthma. No night-time awakenings. No symptoms with exercise, cold air exposure, or laughing. No emergency department visits. Salbutamol last used 10 days ago for the January cold; symptoms resolved within 48 hours. Parents feel confident managing his asthma and are comfortable with the action plan.

Peanut allergy: the school has been fully informed. Two EpiPen Jr devices are on-site (classroom and office). School staff received training in September. Lucas wears a MedicAlert bracelet. There have been no accidental exposures. The school has a "peanut-aware" policy. Lucas understands he cannot eat peanuts and knows to tell an adult if he feels unwell after eating. Parents ask whether allergy testing should be repeated to see if he has outgrown the allergy.

Immunizations: Lucas received his second dose of varicella vaccine (Varivax) in June 2025 and his influenza vaccine in October 2025. Parents confirm these were given at the clinic.

Social and family history: unchanged. Lucas lives with both parents at 18 Parkside Dr, Guelph. No siblings. No smoke exposure. Family dog (golden retriever) was adopted in August 2025 — no impact on Lucas's asthma symptoms noted. No recent travel. No significant life stressors.

Review of systems: no fevers, no weight loss, no headaches, no abdominal pain, no urinary symptoms, no skin changes, no joint pain, no mood or behavioural concerns.

- Skin: No rash, no eczema, no bruising. Well-hydrated.
- Neurological: Alert, interactive, age-appropriate language and behaviour. Gross motor — hops on each foot, skips, catches ball. Fine motor — draws a recognizable person with 6+ body parts, prints first name, uses scissors to cut shapes.

Developmental assessment (5-year milestones):
- Gross motor: Skips, hops on each foot x5+, catches ball with two hands, rides bicycle with training wheels — MEETS expectations
- Fine motor: Prints first name legibly, draws detailed person (head, body, arms, legs, hands, facial features), copies triangle, buttons and zips independently — MEETS expectations
- Language/speech: Speaks in complex sentences, tells stories with a beginning/middle/end, uses future tense, follows 3-step commands, asks "how" and "why" questions — MEETS expectations

### Assessment

1. **Well-child visit, age 5 years 4 months** — growth and development appropriate for age. All developmental milestones met. Growth continues along the 50th-75th percentile corridor, consistent with previous trajectory. Height 110 cm, weight 19.8 kg. School adjustment successful. No academic or behavioural concerns.
2. **Mild intermittent asthma** — remains well controlled on PRN salbutamol only. Frequency of exacerbations (approximately 2-3 per year, all viral-triggered) is stable and consistent with mild intermittent classification. No criteria met for step-up therapy. Successfully transitioned to mouthpiece on AeroChamber. Parents demonstrate excellent understanding of asthma action plan.
3. **Peanut allergy (IgE-mediated)** — stable. Strict avoidance in place. No accidental exposures. School management plan compliant with Sabrina's Law. Parents inquire about repeat testing and possible outgrowth. Approximately 20% of children with peanut allergy outgrow it; repeat testing can be considered. Referral to paediatric allergist appropriate for supervised oral food challenge consideration if parents wish to pursue.
4. **Immunizations** — up to date per Ontario publicly funded schedule for age. DTaP-IPV (4 doses), MMR (2 doses), varicella (2 doses), pneumococcal conjugate (series complete), meningococcal C (1 dose — 2nd dose due at age 12), hepatitis B (series complete), influenza (annual, current season complete). No vaccines due today. Next: influenza October 2026; Tdap-IPV booster at ages 14-16.
5. **EpiPen Jr dosing assessment** — Lucas now weighs 19.8 kg. EpiPen Jr 0.15 mg remains appropriate. Transition to EpiPen 0.3 mg is generally recommended at 25 kg or when the child reaches approximately 25-30 kg. Continue EpiPen Jr for now; reassess at next visit.

### Plan

1. **Asthma management** — continue current approach. Salbutamol HFA 100 mcg/puff via AeroChamber with mouthpiece, 2 puffs q4h PRN. Asthma action plan reviewed and remains current for school. No changes. If frequency of exacerbations increases (>2 days/week symptoms, or >2 night-time awakenings/month, or interfering with activity), revisit to consider low-dose inhaled corticosteroid.
2. **Peanut allergy management** — continue strict avoidance and EpiPen Jr availability. EpiPen Jr 0.15 mg prescription renewed (x2 auto-injectors). Current devices checked: expiry dates are March 2026 — will need replacement soon. Recommended filling new prescription promptly.
3. **Allergist referral** — discussed repeat allergy testing with parents. Explained that serum-specific IgE to peanut (ImmunoCAP) and/or repeat skin prick testing can help stratify likelihood of tolerance development. Referral placed to Dr. Angela Kim, Paediatric Allergist, Guelph General Hospital Allergy Clinic, for reassessment of peanut allergy and discussion regarding possible supervised oral food challenge or peanut oral immunotherapy program. Wait time estimated at 4-6 months. Parents in agreement.
4. **Dental anticipatory guidance** — lower central incisors are loose; primary tooth shedding is beginning on schedule. Permanent teeth expected to erupt shortly. Continue brushing 2x/day with fluoride toothpaste, dental visits q6 months. No intervention needed for loose teeth — will fall out naturally.
5. **Nutrition and activity** — Lucas is growing well with a balanced diet. Continue encouraging fruits, vegetables, dairy, and protein. Vitamin D 400 IU daily during October-April. Encourage 60 minutes of active play daily. Family reports Lucas is active with outdoor play and has started a swimming lesson program — excellent for overall fitness and a valuable safety skill.
6. **Screen time** — discussed updated Canadian Paediatric Society recommendation: maximum 1-2 hours/day for children age 5+, prioritizing educational content and co-viewing. Parents report Lucas uses a tablet approximately 1 hour/day; this is appropriate.
7. **Safety** — reviewed booster seat transition: Lucas at 19.8 kg is now eligible for a belt-positioning booster seat, though a harnessed car seat remains safest as long as he fits within the harness weight limit. Parents to assess their car seat model specifications. Reviewed bicycle helmet, water safety (swimming lessons already in progress), and stranger safety.
8. **School** — no academic or behavioural concerns raised. Encouraged parents to continue reading together daily and practicing letter-sound recognition in preparation for senior kindergarten (SK) in September 2026.
