- Time: 10:15
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Kingston Family Health Organization, 115 Clarence St, Kingston, ON
- Practitioner: Dr. James Whitfield, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-67812)
- Reason for visit: Annual health examination and atrial fibrillation review

### Subjective
David presents for his annual physical and routine AF follow-up. He reports feeling generally well over the past year. No episodes of palpitations, chest discomfort, or dyspnea since his last visit. He has been compliant with apixaban 5 mg BID and metoprolol 25 mg daily without missed doses. He denies syncope, presyncope, or exercise intolerance. He walks 30–40 minutes most days and has been doing light weightlifting twice per week since retiring from the paramedic service two years ago. He denies alcohol use beyond occasional social consumption (1–2 drinks per month). Non-smoker. Sleep is adequate — denies snoring or witnessed apneas. No bleeding events, bruising, or hematuria on apixaban. Diet is reasonable; he has been trying to limit sodium intake. No new stressors or mood concerns.

### Objective

- Practitioner: Dr. Naveed Hussain, MD FRCPC (ON-PRAC-75892)
- Reason for visit: Routine cardiology follow-up for paroxysmal AF; echocardiogram review

### Subjective
Referred by Dr. Whitfield for routine AF surveillance and repeat echocardiogram. David reports no symptomatic AF episodes over the past several months. He notes occasional awareness of his heartbeat when lying on his left side at night, but no sustained palpitations, dizziness, or chest pain. Exercise tolerance is good — walks daily and does light resistance training without limitation. No dyspnea on exertion. Compliant with apixaban 5 mg BID and metoprolol 25 mg daily. He recalls his last cardioversion was in 2021 and has not required another since. Denies alcohol excess, caffeine excess (1–2 coffees per day), or illicit drug use.

### Objective
- **Vitals:** BP 126/76 mmHg, HR 68 bpm (irregularly irregular), SpO₂ 99% RA
- **Cardiovascular exam:** Irregularly irregular rhythm, normal S1/S2, no murmurs or gallops, no JVD, no peripheral edema
- **ECG (clinic):** Atrial fibrillation, ventricular rate 70 bpm, normal axis, no LVH voltage criteria, no ST-T wave abnormalities
- **Transthoracic Echocardiogram (performed 2024-05-22):**
  - LV ejection fraction 58% (normal)
  - Normal LV wall thickness and chamber dimensions
  - Left atrial volume index 32 mL/m² (upper limit of normal)
  - No significant valvular disease — trace mitral regurgitation, trace tricuspid regurgitation
  - Normal RV size and function
  - No pericardial effusion
  - Estimated PASP 28 mmHg (normal)

### Assessment
1. **Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation** — rate well controlled on low-dose metoprolol. Echocardiogram reassuring with preserved LV function and only mildly dilated left atrium (LA volume index at upper limit of normal, stable compared to 2022 echo where LAVI was 30 mL/m²). No progression of structural heart disease.
2. **Anticoagulation** — CHA₂DS₂-VASc = 1. Apixaban well tolerated. Renal function adequate. Continue current regimen.
3. **No indication for rhythm control escalation** at this time — patient is minimally symptomatic (EHRA class I–II), rate controlled, structurally preserved heart.

### Plan
1. Continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mg PO daily for rate control.
2. Continue apixaban 5 mg PO BID for stroke prevention.
3. No change in management — reassuring echo findings.
4. Consider 48-hour Holter monitor at next follow-up (in approximately 12 months) to assess AF burden.
5. Advise patient to present to ED if prolonged symptomatic episode with hemodynamic compromise.
6. Report sent to Dr. Whitfield.

### Disposition

## Encounter 3: 2024-08-09 — Emergency Visit — AF Episode with Palpitations

- Date: 2024-08-09
- Time: 22:45
- Type: Emergency
- Setting: Emergency Department
- Organization: Kingston Health Sciences Centre, Kingston, ON
- Practitioner: Dr. Thomas Beaulieu, MD FRCPC (Emergency Medicine)
- Reason for visit: Acute onset palpitations, chest tightness, lightheadedness

### Subjective
David presents to the ED via personal vehicle with a 3-hour history of sudden-onset rapid palpitations, chest tightness, and lightheadedness. He was watching television at approximately 19:30 when he felt a sudden "fluttering" in his chest followed by a rapid heartbeat. He attempted vagal maneuvers (Valsalva, cold water to face) without relief. Over the ensuing hours, he developed mild chest pressure (non-radiating), felt lightheaded on standing, and became increasingly anxious. He denies syncope, diaphoresis, nausea, or vomiting. No preceding illness, unusual exertion, or dietary indiscretion. He had two glasses of wine earlier in the evening, which he acknowledges is more than his usual intake. He is compliant with his medications — took his apixaban this morning and this evening, and his metoprolol this morning. He has not had an episode this severe since his cardioversion in 2021. He reports mild dyspnea with activity but can speak in full sentences at rest. As a retired paramedic, he recognized the episode as likely AF with rapid ventricular response.

### Objective
- **Vitals (triage):** BP 108/68 mmHg, HR 142 bpm (irregularly irregular), RR 20, SpO₂ 96% RA, Temp 36.8°C
- **Vitals (reassessment at 23:30):** BP 112/72 mmHg, HR 134 bpm
- **General:** Anxious-appearing male, mildly diaphoretic, alert and oriented
- **Cardiovascular:** Tachycardic, irregularly irregular, no murmurs, no JVD, peripheral pulses palpable but rapid
- **Respiratory:** Clear bilaterally, no crackles or wheeze
- **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender
- **Extremities:** No edema, calves soft and non-tender
- **ECG:** Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, rate 144 bpm, normal axis, no acute ST-T changes, no delta waves, QTc difficult to assess given irregularity
- **Labs:**
  - Troponin HS: <5 ng/L (normal) — repeat at 3 hours: 6 ng/L (normal)
  - CBC: WBC 7.8, Hgb 148 g/L, Plt 224
  - Creatinine 88 µmol/L, Na 139, K 4.1 mmol/L, Mg 0.78 mmol/L (low-normal)
  - TSH 1.9 mIU/L
  - INR: not indicated (on DOAC)
- **Chest X-ray:** No cardiomegaly, no pulmonary edema, no consolidation

### Assessment
1. **Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response** — acute symptomatic episode in the context of known paroxysmal AF. Likely triggered by increased alcohol intake. Hemodynamically stable but symptomatic. Troponin negative, no evidence of ACS. No signs of heart failure.
2. **Borderline hypomagnesemia** — Mg 0.78 mmol/L (reference 0.74–1.03); may contribute to arrhythmia irritability.

### Plan
1. **Rate control:** Metoprolol IV 5 mg slow push x 1, reassess in 15 minutes.
   - Post-metoprolol IV (23:15): HR decreased to 112 bpm, BP 116/74 mmHg. Patient reports mild improvement in symptoms.
   - Additional metoprolol IV 5 mg at 23:30: HR 96 bpm, BP 118/72 mmHg. Palpitations significantly improved.
2. **Magnesium supplementation:** MgSO₄ 2 g IV over 1 hour.
3. Apixaban confirmed taken today — no need for bridging anticoagulation. Continue home dose.
4. Oral metoprolol tartrate 50 mg given at 01:00 (increased from home dose of 25 mg for acute rate control).
5. **Observation:** Monitored in ED observation for 4 hours. By 03:00, HR 82 bpm, irregularly irregular, BP 122/74, symptoms resolved. Patient comfortable, ambulating without lightheadedness.
6. **Discharge plan:**
   - Increase metoprolol tartrate to 50 mg PO daily (from 25 mg) until reviewed by family physician or cardiologist.
   - Continue apixaban 5 mg BID — no changes.
   - Avoid alcohol — counsel on AF trigger avoidance.
   - Follow up with Dr. Whitfield (FP) within 1 week.
   - Expedited cardiology follow-up with Dr. Hussain recommended.
   - Return to ED if recurrent rapid palpitations, syncope, chest pain, or dyspnea at rest.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: Dr. Whitfield (FP) within 1 week; expedited cardiology follow-up
- Referrals: Notification faxed to Dr. Whitfield and Dr. Hussain

- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Kingston Family Health Organization, 115 Clarence St, Kingston, ON
- Practitioner: Dr. James Whitfield, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-67812)
- Reason for visit: Post-ED follow-up after acute AF episode on Aug 9

### Subjective
David presents one week after his ED visit at Kingston Health Sciences Centre for an acute AF episode with rapid ventricular response. He reports that since discharge, he has felt significantly better. He had mild fatigue for 2–3 days following the episode but has since returned to his usual baseline. No recurrence of rapid palpitations, though he notes occasional irregular heartbeats consistent with his usual AF. No chest pain, dyspnea, syncope, or presyncope. He has been taking metoprolol 50 mg daily as instructed at discharge (increased from his prior 25 mg dose) along with his usual apixaban 5 mg BID. He has abstained from alcohol since the episode and acknowledges the two glasses of wine likely contributed. He is sleeping well and has resumed walking but has held off on weightlifting until cleared. He received a copy of the ED discharge summary and is aware that an expedited cardiology follow-up has been requested.

### Objective
- **Vitals:** BP 118/72 mmHg, HR 70 bpm (irregularly irregular), RR 14, SpO₂ 98% RA
- **Weight:** 82.3 kg
- **General:** Well-appearing, no distress, rested
- **Cardiovascular:** Irregularly irregular rhythm, rate well controlled, no murmurs, no JVD, no peripheral edema
- **Respiratory:** Clear bilaterally
- **ECG (in-office):** Atrial fibrillation, ventricular rate 72 bpm, no ST-T changes — improved rate control compared to ED presentation
- **ED records reviewed:** Troponin negative x 2, electrolytes stable, CXR clear, magnesium low-normal

### Assessment
1. **Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation** — status post acute RVR episode requiring ED visit and IV metoprolol. Currently rate-controlled on increased metoprolol dose (50 mg daily). No recurrent symptomatic episodes in the past week.
2. **Alcohol as AF trigger** — patient counselled and currently abstaining.
3. **Medication adjustment** — metoprolol uptitrated from 25 mg to 50 mg daily at ED discharge. Tolerating well without symptomatic bradycardia or hypotension.

### Plan
1. Continue metoprolol tartrate 50 mg PO daily — maintain increased dose; reassess at cardiology follow-up.
2. Continue apixaban 5 mg PO BID.
3. Strongly reinforce alcohol avoidance or strict limitation (no more than 1 standard drink on any occasion, no more than 2 per week). Discussed evidence linking alcohol intake and AF episodes.
4. May resume light exercise including walking and gradual return to weightlifting; avoid heavy exertion until cardiology review.
5. Confirmed expedited cardiology referral to Dr. Hussain — appointment expected within 6–8 weeks.
6. Repeat bloodwork in 4 weeks: CBC, Cr, electrolytes (including Mg), LFTs.
7. Return sooner if recurrent palpitations, lightheadedness, or any concerning symptoms.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 4 weeks for bloodwork review; or sooner if symptomatic
- Referrals: Expedited cardiology referral to Dr. Hussain (in progress)

## Encounter 5: 2024-10-03 — Cardiology Follow-up — Post-Episode Management

- Date: 2024-10-03
- Time: 13:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Specialist Clinic
- Organization: Peterborough Regional Specialist Clinic (outreach — Hamilton General Hospital Cardiology)
- Practitioner: Dr. Naveed Hussain, MD FRCPC (ON-PRAC-75892)
- Reason for visit: Expedited cardiology follow-up after acute AF episode with RVR (Aug 2024)

### Subjective
David presents for expedited cardiology follow-up following his ED visit on August 9, 2024, for an AF episode with rapid ventricular response (HR 142 bpm). He reports no further symptomatic episodes since that event. He has been on metoprolol 50 mg daily (uptitrated from 25 mg at ED discharge) and has tolerated the higher dose well. He occasionally feels a few irregular beats, particularly when lying down at night, but no sustained palpitations, no chest pain, no dyspnea, and no lightheadedness. He has been walking daily and resumed light weightlifting two weeks ago without issue. He has been abstaining from alcohol since the episode. He notes improved energy and sleep quality. He saw Dr. Whitfield on August 16 and had follow-up bloodwork on September 13 — he understands it was normal.

### Objective
- **Vitals:** BP 120/74 mmHg, HR 66 bpm (irregularly irregular), SpO₂ 98% RA
- **Weight:** 81.9 kg (slight decrease from prior visits)
- **Cardiovascular exam:** Irregularly irregular rhythm, well controlled, no murmurs, gallops, or rubs, no JVD, no pedal edema
- **ECG (clinic):** Atrial fibrillation, ventricular rate 68 bpm, normal axis, no ST-T changes, no LVH
- **Recent bloodwork (2024-09-13, from Dr. Whitfield):**
  - CBC: WBC 5.8, Hgb 150 g/L, Plt 210
  - Creatinine 82 µmol/L, eGFR >60
  - Na 141, K 4.2, Mg 0.86 mmol/L (improved from 0.78 in ED)
  - ALT 24 U/L
- **Prior echo (May 2024):** LVEF 58%, LAVI 32 mL/m², no significant valvular disease — reviewed

### Assessment
1. **Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation** — status post acute RVR episode (Aug 2024), now rate-controlled on metoprolol 50 mg daily. Hemodynamically stable. No recurrent symptomatic episodes in 8 weeks. Alcohol likely precipitant — now abstaining. Echo from May 2024 shows preserved LV function and stable mild LA dilation.
2. **Rate vs. rhythm control strategy:** Patient is minimally symptomatic at baseline (EHRA class I). Current rate control strategy is appropriate. No compelling indication for rhythm control (antiarrhythmic drugs or ablation) at this time. Would reconsider if episodes become more frequent or symptomatic despite rate control.
3. **Anticoagulation** — CHA₂DS₂-VASc = 1. Continue apixaban. Renal function adequate for full dosing.

### Plan
1. Continue metoprolol tartrate 50 mg PO daily — good rate control achieved. No need to return to 25 mg at this time.
2. Continue apixaban 5 mg PO BID.
3. Order 48-hour Holter monitor to assess AF burden and ensure no periods of uncontrolled rate — to be done in approximately 6–8 months. Holter requisition provided.
4. Reinforce alcohol avoidance. Counsel on other triggers: sleep deprivation, caffeine excess, dehydration.
5. Encourage continued regular aerobic exercise.
6. No indication for antiarrhythmic therapy or catheter ablation at present — to be revisited if recurrent symptomatic episodes.
7. Follow-up in cardiology in 8–10 months after Holter completion.
8. Report sent to Dr. Whitfield.
9. Patient advised to present to ED if prolonged symptomatic episodes or hemodynamic compromise.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: Cardiology in 8–10 months (after Holter); sooner if recurrent episodes
- Referrals: 48-hour Holter monitor requisition provided

- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Kingston Family Health Organization, 115 Clarence St, Kingston, ON
- Practitioner: Dr. James Whitfield, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-67812)
- Reason for visit: Routine follow-up — AF rate control review and medication renewal

### Subjective
David presents for a scheduled follow-up to review his AF management, now 5 months since his last acute episode (August 2024). He reports feeling well overall. He continues to deny any recurrent symptomatic AF episodes — no sustained palpitations, chest pain, syncope, or dyspnea. He does note occasional brief (seconds-long) fluttering sensations, perhaps once every 2–3 weeks, which resolve spontaneously. These do not limit his activity. He has been compliant with metoprolol 50 mg daily and apixaban 5 mg BID. He continues to avoid alcohol entirely and limits caffeine to one cup of coffee in the morning. He walks 40 minutes daily and does resistance training three times per week. He reports he has been sleeping well and his mood is stable. No bleeding events, bruising, or hematuria. He has not yet completed the Holter monitor ordered by Dr. Hussain — he reports difficulty scheduling and will follow up on this.

### Objective
- **Vitals:** BP 122/74 mmHg, HR 64 bpm (irregularly irregular), RR 14, SpO₂ 98% RA
- **Weight:** 81.5 kg (down from 82.7 kg at annual in March 2024)
- **General:** Well-appearing, fit
- **Cardiovascular:** Irregularly irregular rhythm, rate well controlled, no murmurs, no JVD, no edema
- **No new ECG today** — recent ECGs consistent; rate controlled

### Assessment
1. **Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation** — well controlled on metoprolol 50 mg daily. No further acute episodes since August 2024. Occasional brief awareness of irregular rhythm but clinically insignificant.
2. **Anticoagulation** — apixaban well tolerated. No bleeding complications.
3. **Lifestyle** — positive changes: alcohol abstinence, regular exercise, modest weight reduction.
4. **Outstanding investigation** — 48-hour Holter monitor (ordered Oct 2024) not yet completed.

### Plan
1. Continue metoprolol tartrate 50 mg PO daily.
2. Continue apixaban 5 mg PO BID.
3. Renew prescriptions: metoprolol x 6 months, apixaban x 6 months.
4. Strongly encourage completion of 48-hour Holter monitor before cardiology follow-up — patient will call Peterborough Regional to book.
5. Bloodwork requisition for annual labs (to be drawn ahead of April annual physical): CBC, Cr, eGFR, electrolytes, Mg, fasting glucose, HbA1c, lipid panel, TSH, ALT.
6. Reinforce ongoing lifestyle measures — excellent compliance.
7. Next routine visit: annual physical in approximately April 2025.

### Disposition

## Encounter 8: 2025-07-17 — Cardiology Follow-up — Holter Results

- Date: 2025-07-17
- Time: 14:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Specialist Clinic
- Organization: Peterborough Regional Specialist Clinic (outreach — Hamilton General Hospital Cardiology)
- Practitioner: Dr. Naveed Hussain, MD FRCPC (ON-PRAC-75892)
- Reason for visit: Cardiology follow-up — 48-hour Holter monitor results review

### Subjective
David presents for scheduled cardiology follow-up, primarily to review his 48-hour Holter monitor results (recorded March 18–20, 2025). He reports continued clinical stability — no symptomatic AF episodes since August 2024 (now nearly 12 months). He has occasional awareness of irregular beats, unchanged from prior visits. No palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, syncope, or exercise intolerance. He continues metoprolol 50 mg daily and apixaban 5 mg BID without adverse effects. He has lost approximately 2 kg over the past year through sustained lifestyle changes. He remains abstinent from alcohol. He volunteers regularly and maintains a physically active routine. He saw Dr. Whitfield in April 2025 for his annual physical — labs were all normal.

### Objective
- **Vitals:** BP 118/72 mmHg, HR 64 bpm (irregularly irregular), SpO₂ 99% RA
- **Weight:** 80.5 kg
- **Cardiovascular exam:** Irregularly irregular rhythm at controlled rate, no murmurs, no JVD, no edema
- **ECG (clinic):** Atrial fibrillation, ventricular rate 62 bpm, normal axis, unchanged from prior
- **48-Hour Holter Monitor Report (recorded 2025-03-18 to 2025-03-20):**
  - Total recording time: 48 hours
  - Predominant rhythm: Atrial fibrillation (AF present 68% of recording time)
  - Periods of sinus rhythm identified: several episodes lasting 20 minutes to 3.5 hours (32% of recording)
  - Average ventricular rate in AF: 72 bpm
  - Minimum HR: 48 bpm (during sleep, in AF — adequate)
  - Maximum HR: 118 bpm (brief, during physical activity — appropriate physiological response)
  - No pauses >2.5 seconds
  - No ventricular tachycardia
  - Rare PVCs (34 total, <0.1% burden)
  - No significant bradycardia or high-grade AV block
  - Patient diary: asymptomatic throughout recording period

### Assessment
1. **Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation** — Holter reveals a moderate AF burden (68% over 48 hours) despite clinical impression of "paroxysmal" disease. However, patient is functionally asymptomatic (EHRA class I) with excellent rate control. Average rate 72 bpm in AF; no concerning bradycardia or tachycardia. No ventricular arrhythmias.
2. **Reclassification consideration:** AF burden of 68% raises the question of whether this is evolving toward persistent AF. Clinically, patient alternates between AF and sinus rhythm, and prior ECGs have shown both — consistent with paroxysmal-to-persistent continuum. The distinction is less important than the management strategy.
3. **Rate control** — well achieved on metoprolol 50 mg daily. Minimum HR 48 bpm during sleep is acceptable without symptoms.
4. **Anticoagulation** — with AF burden of 68%, anticoagulation is clearly warranted. Continue apixaban.
5. **Rhythm control consideration:** Given the patient's asymptomatic status, preserved LV function, stable LA dimensions, and absence of heart failure, the current rate control strategy remains appropriate. Catheter ablation or antiarrhythmic drug therapy would be considered if symptoms develop or if LV function deteriorates.

### Plan
1. Continue metoprolol tartrate 50 mg PO daily — effective rate control.
2. Continue apixaban 5 mg PO BID — essential given AF burden.
3. Repeat echocardiogram in 12 months to monitor LA dimensions and LV function, given higher-than-expected AF burden.
4. Discussed catheter ablation as an option if the patient's AF becomes symptomatic or if there is evidence of tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy on future imaging. Patient understands and prefers conservative management for now.
5. Reinforce lifestyle measures — weight management, exercise, alcohol avoidance, stress reduction.
6. Follow-up in cardiology in 12 months with repeat echo.
7. Report and Holter results sent to Dr. Whitfield.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: Cardiology in 12 months with repeat echocardiogram
- Referrals: Echo requisition provided (to be done prior to next cardiology visit)

## Encounter 9: 2025-11-18 — FP Visit — Medication Renewal and Lifestyle Review

- Date: 2025-11-18
- Time: 14:15
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Kingston Family Health Organization, 115 Clarence St, Kingston, ON
- Practitioner: Dr. James Whitfield, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-67812)
- Reason for visit: Medication renewal, lifestyle review, and cardiology results discussion

### Subjective
David presents for a routine follow-up and medication renewal. He continues to feel well with no acute concerns. He has now been 15 months since his last symptomatic AF episode (August 2024). He reviewed the Holter results with Dr. Hussain in July and understands that his AF burden is moderate (68%) despite being largely asymptomatic. He continues to prefer the rate control approach and is not interested in pursuing ablation at this time. He remains on metoprolol 50 mg daily and apixaban 5 mg BID. No adverse medication effects. No bleeding, bruising, or hematuria. He reports he has been doing well with his volunteer work in community paramedicine and stays active. He walks daily and has been doing indoor cycling during the colder months. He has maintained alcohol abstinence. Sleep is good. Mood is stable. He had his influenza vaccine at a pharmacy in October. He denies any new symptoms — no chest pain, dyspnea, orthopnea, PND, or leg swelling.

### Objective
- **Vitals:** BP 120/72 mmHg, HR 66 bpm (irregularly irregular), RR 14, SpO₂ 98% RA
- **Weight:** 80.2 kg (continued gradual reduction from 82.7 kg in March 2024)
- **BMI:** 25.6
- **General:** Well-appearing, in no distress
- **Cardiovascular:** Irregularly irregular rhythm, controlled rate, no murmurs, no JVD, no edema
- **Cardiology report reviewed (Dr. Hussain, July 2025):** Holter showed 68% AF burden, well rate-controlled, no VT, rare PVCs. Rate control strategy maintained. Repeat echo ordered for 2026.

### Assessment
1. **Paroxysmal-to-persistent atrial fibrillation** — stable. Well controlled on metoprolol 50 mg daily. No symptomatic episodes in >15 months. High AF burden (68%) on Holter but asymptomatic — rate control strategy appropriate per cardiology.
2. **Anticoagulation** — apixaban 5 mg BID well tolerated. No bleeding complications. Continue indefinitely given AF burden.
3. **Cardiovascular health** — continued improvement in weight (total loss 2.5 kg over 20 months), maintained exercise, alcohol abstinence. Lipids within target on lifestyle alone.
4. **General health** — stable. Influenza vaccine completed.

### Plan
1. Renew metoprolol tartrate 50 mg PO daily x 6 months.
2. Renew apixaban 5 mg PO BID x 6 months.
3. Annual bloodwork requisition provided (to be drawn in late January 2026, ahead of next visit): CBC, Cr, eGFR, electrolytes, Mg, fasting glucose, HbA1c, lipid panel, TSH, ALT.
4. Echocardiogram requisition for early 2026 (ordered by Dr. Hussain) — patient to book at Peterborough Regional.
5. Reinforce lifestyle measures — excellent ongoing compliance.
6. COVID-19 booster recommended when available — patient will consider.
7. Next visit: February/March 2026 for annual physical and lab review, timed to coordinate with upcoming cardiology follow-up.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: February/March 2026 for annual physical
- Referrals: None new; echo and cardiology follow-up previously arranged

## Encounter 10: 2026-02-10 — AF Follow-up / Annual Cardiovascular Labs

- Date: 2026-02-10
- Time: 09:45
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Kingston Family Health Organization, 115 Clarence St, Kingston, ON
- Practitioner: Dr. James Whitfield, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-67812)
- Reason for visit: Annual cardiovascular review, lab results, pre-cardiology assessment

### Subjective
David presents for his annual cardiovascular review and bloodwork discussion. He continues to do well. He has now been 18 months since his last symptomatic AF episode. He notes that he has been more aware of his heartbeat recently — occasional irregular beats, perhaps slightly more frequent than before, occurring a few times per week. He describes them as brief (lasting seconds to a minute), not associated with chest pain, dyspnea, or lightheadedness. They do not limit his activity. He wonders if his AF burden may be increasing. He completed his echocardiogram at Peterborough Regional on January 28, 2026. He remains compliant with metoprolol 50 mg daily and apixaban 5 mg BID. No adverse effects. No bleeding. He continues to exercise regularly — walking and indoor cycling. He has maintained his weight loss and continues alcohol abstinence. He plans to see Dr. Hussain in the coming months for his scheduled cardiology follow-up and echo review. Mood is good; he is enjoying his retirement and volunteer work.

### Objective
- **Vitals:** BP 126/76 mmHg, HR 70 bpm (irregularly irregular), RR 14, SpO₂ 98% RA, Temp 36.6°C
- **Weight:** 80.4 kg
- **BMI:** 25.7
- **General:** Well-appearing, comfortable
- **Cardiovascular:** Irregularly irregular rhythm, controlled rate, no murmurs, gallops, or rubs, no JVD, no peripheral edema
- **Respiratory:** Clear bilaterally
- **Labs (fasting, drawn 2026-01-27):**
  - CBC: WBC 6.0, Hgb 149 g/L, Plt 220
  - Creatinine 82 µmol/L, eGFR >60
  - Na 140, K 4.3, Mg 0.85 mmol/L
  - Fasting glucose 5.3 mmol/L, HbA1c 5.5%
  - Lipid panel: TC 4.6, LDL 2.5, HDL 1.4, TG 1.5 mmol/L
  - TSH 2.0 mIU/L
  - ALT 26 U/L
- **ECG (in-office):** Atrial fibrillation, ventricular rate 72 bpm, normal axis, no ST-T changes, unchanged from prior
- **Echocardiogram (2026-01-28, Peterborough Regional — preliminary report):**
  - LV ejection fraction 56% (low-normal, slight decrease from 58% in May 2024 — within measurement variability)
  - Normal LV wall thickness and chamber dimensions
  - Left atrial volume index 34 mL/m² (mildly dilated, slight increase from 32 mL/m² in May 2024)
  - Trace mitral regurgitation (unchanged)
  - Trace tricuspid regurgitation (unchanged)
  - Normal RV size and function
  - Estimated PASP 30 mmHg (normal)

### Assessment
1. **Paroxysmal-to-persistent atrial fibrillation** — clinically stable, rate well controlled. Patient reports slightly more frequent awareness of irregular beats, though still non-limiting. Echo shows marginal increase in LA volume index (32 to 34 mL/m²) and borderline decrease in LVEF (58% to 56%), both within measurement variability but worth monitoring. No signs of clinical heart failure.
2. **Anticoagulation** — apixaban well tolerated, renal function supports full dosing. Continue indefinitely.
3. **Cardiovascular risk** — LDL 2.5 mmol/L, borderline. With AF and age now 51, may warrant reconsideration of statin therapy. Framingham risk: low-to-intermediate.
4. **General health** — metabolic parameters all within normal limits. Thyroid stable. Weight stable at reduced level.

### Plan
1. Continue metoprolol tartrate 50 mg PO daily.
2. Continue apixaban 5 mg PO BID.
3. Discuss statin therapy: reviewed CCS guidelines — with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (AF, age >50, LDL 2.5, male), a statin may provide benefit. Patient agrees to start rosuvastatin 10 mg PO daily. Prescribed x 6 months. Recheck lipids and CK in 3 months to assess response and tolerability.
4. Echo results to be formally reviewed by Dr. Hussain at upcoming cardiology visit. The marginal changes in LAVI and LVEF will require serial monitoring.
5. If Dr. Hussain identifies progressive LA dilation or LV dysfunction, rhythm control strategy (ablation or antiarrhythmic) may need to be reconsidered.
6. Continue lifestyle measures — patient well-engaged.
7. Ensure cardiology appointment is booked for spring 2026.
8. Repeat bloodwork in 3 months (lipid panel, CK, ALT) to monitor statin initiation.
9. Annual bloodwork otherwise satisfactory.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 3 months for statin follow-up; annual physical in spring 2026
- Referrals: Cardiology follow-up with Dr. Hussain — appointment to be confirmed for spring 2026
