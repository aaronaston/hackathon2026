### Subjective

Noah Patel is a 12-year-old male presenting with his mother for his annual physical examination and first dose of the HPV vaccine. He is in Grade 7 at a Brampton public school. His mother reports he is doing well overall — no concerns about his general health, mood, or behaviour. He is active in school and plays on a competitive outdoor soccer team (year-round training, outdoor season starting in May). He eats a varied diet, including school lunches, and drinks milk daily. He sleeps approximately 9 hours per night on school days and slightly more on weekends. Screen time is moderate, estimated at 1.5-2 hours daily outside of school. He denies headaches, abdominal pain, changes in vision, or musculoskeletal complaints. No history of concussion or significant sports injuries. He has not yet started shaving. His mother notes that he has grown noticeably taller in the past 6-8 months but has not had a major growth spurt yet. No voice deepening reported. No concerns about school performance; grades are average to above average. No bullying reported. He denies feeling sad or anxious. He denies use of tobacco, alcohol, vaping, or drugs. No sexual activity. His mother asked about the school-based HPV vaccination program; they opted to receive the vaccine here at the family health team instead of through the school clinic, as they preferred their family physician to administer it. Past medical history is unremarkable. No chronic conditions. No surgeries. No hospitalizations. No known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental allergens. No current medications or supplements. Immunizations are up to date per Ontario schedule (last reviewed at age 11 visit). Family history: father has type 2 diabetes (diagnosed age 42); mother is healthy; one younger sibling (age 9), healthy.

### Assessment

1. **Healthy adolescent male, age 12** — growth and development are age-appropriate. Height and weight tracking along the 50th-75th percentiles. BMI within healthy range. Early puberty (Tanner stage II), consistent with normal pubertal onset for males (typically age 9-14). No concerns regarding growth velocity at this time; anticipate growth spurt in the coming 1-2 years.
2. **Routine immunization — HPV vaccine (Gardasil 9), dose 1** — indicated per Ontario publicly funded school-based immunization program for Grade 7 students. Family opted to receive the vaccine at the family health team. For individuals under age 15 at first dose, a 2-dose schedule (0 and 6-12 months) is recommended.
3. **Mental health and substance use screening** — negative. No concerns identified.
4. **Scoliosis screening** — negative (Adam's test).
5. **Family history of type 2 diabetes (paternal)** — noted for long-term risk awareness. No current concerns given healthy BMI and active lifestyle.

### Plan

1. Administered Gardasil 9 (9-valent HPV vaccine) 0.5 mL IM in left deltoid. Lot number: R032841. Expiry: 2025-01-15. Administered by RN Tina Cheung. Patient observed for 15 minutes post-injection; no adverse reaction. Site reviewed — no swelling, redness, or induration. Counselled on expected mild soreness at injection site for 1-2 days; acetaminophen or ibuprofen PRN.
2. Dose 2 of Gardasil 9 to be scheduled in 6-12 months (target: October 2024 to April 2025). Reminder to be sent via clinic system.
3. Discussed age-appropriate anticipatory guidance with Noah and his mother:
   - Puberty: reviewed expected changes (growth spurt, voice changes, body hair, skin changes/acne) over the next 1-3 years; reassured that his current stage is normal.
   - Nutrition: encouraged continued balanced diet with adequate calcium and protein for bone and muscle growth; discussed importance of hydration during soccer season.

## Encounter 2: 2024-10-19 — Left Ankle Sprain (Soccer Injury)

- Date: 2024-10-19
- Time: 10:30
- Type: Walk-in
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Brampton Civic Family Health Team (40 Finchgate Blvd, Suite 302, Brampton, ON)
- Practitioner: Dr. Angela Russo, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-62847)
- Reason for visit: Left ankle pain following soccer injury yesterday

### Subjective

Noah presents on a walk-in basis with his father, reporting left ankle pain following a soccer injury the previous evening. During an outdoor competitive match, he planted his left foot and rolled his ankle inward while changing direction at approximately 6:30 PM. He felt a "pop" and immediate sharp pain on the outside of the left ankle. He was unable to continue playing and was helped off the field. He was able to bear some weight immediately after but with significant pain. His father applied ice intermittently for 20 minutes at a time last evening and gave him ibuprofen 200 mg before bed. This morning the ankle is swollen, particularly over the outer aspect, and there is mild bruising beginning to appear below the lateral malleolus. He rates the pain as 5/10 at rest and 7/10 with weight-bearing. He is limping but able to walk short distances. No numbness or tingling in the foot. No injuries to any other body part. No head contact, no loss of consciousness, no symptoms of concussion. No previous ankle sprains or significant lower extremity injuries. No allergies. No medications other than the ibuprofen given last evening.

### Objective

- Vitals: BP 108/64 mmHg, HR 80 bpm, Temp 36.5 C
- General: Well-appearing adolescent male, sitting comfortably at rest, antalgic gait on the left when walking into room
- Left ankle examination:
  - Inspection: Moderate soft tissue swelling over the lateral malleolus, extending slightly inferior and anterior. Mild ecchymosis forming along the inframalleolar region laterally. No gross deformity. No open wounds.
  - Palpation: Tenderness maximal over the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL). Mild tenderness over the calcaneofibular ligament (CFL). No tenderness over the posterior edge or tip of the lateral malleolus (within 6 cm of the tip). No tenderness over the posterior edge or tip of the medial malleolus. No tenderness over the base of the 5th metatarsal. No tenderness over the navicular bone.
  - Range of motion: Dorsiflexion mildly limited by pain; plantarflexion intact; inversion reproduces lateral pain; eversion intact.
  - Anterior drawer test: Mildly positive — slight increased laxity compared to the right side, with endpoint present. Pain with testing.
  - Talar tilt test: Negative — no significant laxity.
  - Squeeze test (proximal fibula): Negative — no pain (syndesmosis not involved).
  - Neurovascular: Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses palpable and equal bilaterally. Capillary refill <2 seconds all toes. Sensation intact to light touch in all dermatomes of the foot.
- Right ankle: Normal, no swelling, no tenderness, full ROM, used as comparison.
- Ottawa Ankle Rules: Negative — able to bear weight (four steps) both immediately after injury and in clinic; no bony tenderness at posterior edge or tip of either malleolus, base of 5th metatarsal, or navicular. Radiographs not indicated.

### Assessment

1. **Grade II lateral ankle sprain, left** — mechanism consistent with inversion injury. Tenderness and mild laxity over the ATFL with involvement of the CFL. Anterior drawer mildly positive with endpoint, suggesting partial but not complete ligament tear. No clinical findings suggesting fracture (Ottawa Ankle Rules negative). No syndesmotic involvement. Neurovascularly intact.

### Plan

1. **RICE protocol** — reviewed and reinforced with Noah and his father:
   - **Rest:** Avoid weight-bearing activities, running, and soccer. Crutches provided (fitted to height) for use over the next 3-5 days or as needed for comfort; may transition to weight-bearing as tolerated once able to walk without significant pain.
   - **Ice:** Apply ice packs wrapped in a thin towel for 15-20 minutes every 2-3 hours while awake for the first 48-72 hours to reduce swelling.
   - **Compression:** Fitted with a lace-up ankle brace (provided from clinic stock). Instructed to wear during the day over a thin sock. May use a tensor bandage wrap as an alternative overnight if more comfortable. Avoid wrapping too tightly; if numbness or increased pain occurs, loosen immediately.
   - **Elevation:** Elevate the left foot above heart level when resting, particularly in the first 48-72 hours.
2. **Analgesia:** Ibuprofen 200 mg PO q6-8h PRN with food for pain and inflammation; maximum 600 mg per day. May alternate with acetaminophen 500 mg PO q6h PRN if additional relief needed. Continue for 5-7 days as needed.
3. **No radiographs at this time** — Ottawa Ankle Rules negative. Explained to father that clinical examination is reliable in ruling out fracture in this scenario; X-ray would be obtained if symptoms fail to improve in 5-7 days or if new bony tenderness develops.
4. **Activity restriction:** No soccer, running, jumping, or gym class for a minimum of 2-3 weeks. May attend school; excused from physical education (note provided to school). Return to play will be guided by clinical reassessment.
5. **Return-to-play counselling discussed:**
   - Phase 1 (weeks 1-2): Rest, gentle ankle ROM exercises (alphabet tracing with toes, gentle dorsiflexion/plantarflexion).
   - Phase 2 (weeks 2-3): Progressive weight-bearing, walking normally, begin balance/proprioception exercises (single-leg standing).
   - Phase 3 (weeks 3-4+): Light jogging, sport-specific drills, agility; return to full soccer only when pain-free with full ROM and able to complete sport-specific activities without limitation.
   - Ankle brace recommended for return to soccer and for the remainder of the season.
6. **Return precautions:** Worsening pain, inability to bear weight after 5-7 days, new bony tenderness, significant increase in swelling, numbness or tingling, or symptoms not improving after 2 weeks.
7. Note provided for school excusing Noah from physical education for 3 weeks, to be reassessed.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: 2-3 weeks for reassessment of ankle and clearance for return to activity; sooner if symptoms worsen
- Referrals: None

### Subjective

Noah Patel is a 13-year-old male presenting with his mother for his annual physical examination and his second dose of the HPV vaccine. He is now in Grade 8. His mother reports he has been doing very well. He returned to full soccer activities approximately 4 weeks after his ankle sprain last October and has had no recurrence of ankle symptoms. He completed the fall outdoor season wearing the ankle brace as recommended and played the full indoor winter season without difficulty. The outdoor spring season is about to begin. He reports no current pain, swelling, or instability in the left ankle. He has grown noticeably since his last annual visit — his mother reports he has "shot up" over the winter months and his shoe size has increased by 1.5 sizes. His voice has begun to deepen. He has not yet started shaving but notes some fine hair on his upper lip. He reports mild acne on his forehead and nose, present for approximately 2-3 months, which he manages by washing his face twice daily with a gentle cleanser. No other skin concerns. Appetite has increased significantly; he eats larger portions and is frequently hungry between meals. He sleeps 8-9 hours per night. Screen time is approximately 2 hours daily. He continues to do well in school, with no academic concerns. He has a close group of friends. He denies feeling sad, anxious, or stressed. He denies any bullying or social difficulties. He denies use of tobacco, alcohol, vaping, or drugs. No sexual activity. No new medical conditions since last visit. No current medications or supplements. No allergies. Family history unchanged. His mother asks about his growth trajectory and whether his acne needs treatment.

### Assessment

1. **Healthy adolescent male, age 13** — growth and development are progressing normally. Height gain of 7 cm over 12 months is consistent with early-to-mid pubertal growth spurt. Now at Tanner stage III, progressing appropriately from stage II one year ago. BMI remains in the healthy range. Weight gain proportional to height increase. Anticipate continued growth acceleration over the next 1-2 years.
2. **Mild comedonal acne** — non-inflammatory, limited to the forehead and nasal bridge. Common and expected with pubertal hormonal changes. No scarring. Does not meet criteria for moderate or severe acne.
3. **Left ankle sprain (October 2024) — resolved** — full ROM, no residual laxity, no tenderness. Functionally returned to full competitive soccer without limitations. No further intervention needed.
4. **HPV vaccination — Gardasil 9, dose 2 of 2** — due today. First dose was administered April 2024 (12 months ago), which falls within the acceptable 6-12 month interval for the 2-dose schedule in individuals who received dose 1 before age 15.
5. **Mental health and substance use screening** — negative. No concerns.
6. **Scoliosis screening** — negative.

### Plan

1. Administered Gardasil 9 (9-valent HPV vaccine) 0.5 mL IM in left deltoid. Lot number: T045923. Expiry: 2025-09-30. Administered by RN Tina Cheung. Patient observed for 15 minutes post-injection; no adverse reaction. Counselled on expected mild soreness at injection site. HPV series now complete (2-dose schedule).
2. Updated Ontario immunization records (DHIR — Digital Health Immunization Repository) to reflect series completion. Printed updated immunization record for mother to provide to school.
3. **Acne management:**
   - Current gentle face-washing regimen twice daily is appropriate. Advised to avoid harsh scrubbing or picking at comedones.
   - Recommended starting benzoyl peroxide 5% gel (OTC), applied as a thin layer to affected areas once daily at bedtime. Begin with every other day for the first week to assess tolerance, then increase to nightly. May cause mild dryness or peeling initially; use a non-comedogenic moisturizer if needed.
   - If no improvement in 6-8 weeks, or if inflammatory lesions (red bumps, pustules) develop, return for reassessment and possible addition of a topical retinoid.
   - Avoid oil-based skin products or heavy moisturizers on the face.
4. **Anticipatory guidance discussed:**
   - Puberty: reviewed ongoing expected changes including further growth spurt, voice deepening, increased body hair, body odour management (daily showering, deodorant use), nocturnal emissions — reassured that all are normal.
   - Nutrition: with increased appetite and growth, encouraged adequate protein, calcium (3-4 servings of dairy or equivalent daily), and iron-rich foods. Adequate hydration during soccer particularly important.
   - Sports safety: reviewed importance of continuing to use the ankle brace during soccer. Discussed concussion awareness — signs and symptoms to report to coaches and parents, importance of removal from play if suspected concussion.
   - Mental health: encouraged continued open communication; discussed that mood fluctuations are common in adolescence; provided information about Kids Help Phone (1-800-668-6868) as an additional resource if ever needed.
   - Internet safety: discussed responsible social media use, not sharing personal information, and reporting uncomfortable interactions to a trusted adult.
5. No laboratory investigations indicated at this time.
6. Growth plotted on WHO growth charts — tracking appropriately along the 50th-75th percentile curve for both height and weight.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: 12 months for next annual physical, or sooner as needed for acne reassessment or acute concerns
- Referrals: None
