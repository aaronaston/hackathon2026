### Subjective
Ms. Baptiste is referred by Dr. Robert Osei for optimization of glycemic control. She has had Type 2 diabetes mellitus since 2021, managed with Metformin 1000 mg BID. Her most recent A1c was 7.3% (June 2024), previously 7.4% (March 2024). She has been working on dietary modifications with a registered dietitian and has increased her physical activity. Despite these efforts, A1c remains above the target of < 7.0%.

She reports generally feeling well. Home fasting glucose readings range from 6.0–7.8 mmol/L. She suspects her postprandial readings may be higher but does not routinely check them. No hypoglycemic episodes. No symptoms of hyperglycemia. She had a UTI in August 2024, treated with Nitrofurantoin, which resolved completely. She is concerned about long-term complications and is open to additional medications if needed.

Current medications: Metformin 1000 mg PO BID. No allergies. No other medications or supplements.

Review of systems: Negative for visual changes, chest pain, dyspnea, paresthesias, foot ulcers, or wounds. Menstrual cycles regular.

### Objective

  - No dependent rubor or elevation pallor
- Neurological assessment:
  - 10 g Semmes-Weinstein monofilament: Intact 10/10 sites bilaterally
  - 128 Hz tuning fork (vibration): Intact at bilateral first metatarsophalangeal joints and medial malleoli
  - Proprioception: Intact at bilateral great toes
  - Achilles reflex: 2+ bilaterally
- Musculoskeletal assessment: Normal foot architecture bilaterally. No Charcot deformity, hammer toes, or bunions. Full range of motion at ankles and metatarsophalangeal joints.
- Risk classification (Diabetic Foot Risk Assessment): Low risk — intact sensation, palpable pulses, no deformity, no history of ulceration

### Assessment
1. Low-risk diabetic feet — no evidence of peripheral neuropathy, peripheral arterial disease, or structural deformity. Skin and nails in good condition. ABI values normal bilaterally.
2. Type 2 diabetes mellitus — well managed, contributing to low complication risk.

### Plan
1. No interventions required at this time.
2. Continue daily foot inspection and appropriate footwear.
3. Moisturize feet daily (avoid between toes) to maintain skin integrity.
4. Trim nails straight across to prevent ingrown nails.
5. Report any new numbness, tingling, skin breakdown, colour changes, or temperature differences to Dr. Osei promptly.
6. Annual diabetic foot assessment recommended — next visit approximately November 2026.
7. Report sent to Dr. Robert Osei for patient file.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: Annual diabetic foot care reassessment (November 2026)
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 10: 2026-02-17 — A1c Follow-up / Medication Review

- Date: 2026-02-17
- Time: 10:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Kitchener-Waterloo Family Health Team
- Practitioner: Dr. Robert Osei, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-65189)
- Reason for visit: Six-month A1c follow-up and medication review

### Subjective
Ms. Baptiste presents for her routine A1c follow-up, 6 months since her last comprehensive review. She has been feeling well. She continues to take Metformin 1000 mg BID and Empagliflozin 10 mg daily without any adverse effects. No hypoglycemia. No UTI or genital infections. Home fasting glucose readings have been in the 5.5–6.5 mmol/L range. She reports she has been more consistent with her diet since the fall and has been doing indoor exercise (stationary cycling and stretching) through the winter months given the cold weather in Southwestern Ontario.

She attended her diabetic foot care assessment in November 2025 — she was told her feet are in good condition with no signs of neuropathy or circulation problems, which was reassuring.

She mentions she will be turning 39 this year and recalls the discussion about starting a statin at age 40. She would like to revisit this at her next annual physical. No other concerns today.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 118/74 mmHg, HR 68 bpm
- Weight: 78.3 kg, BMI: 28.1 kg/m²

Lab results (drawn 2026-02-10):
- HbA1c: 7.1% (previous 7.1% in August 2025)
- Fasting glucose: 6.3 mmol/L
- Creatinine: 65 µmol/L, eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73m²
- Urine ACR: 1.0 mg/mmol (normal)

### Assessment
1. Type 2 diabetes mellitus — A1c stable at 7.1% on dual therapy with Metformin and Empagliflozin. This is marginally above the < 7.0% target but represents clinically acceptable control with low risk of hypoglycemia. Renal function preserved, urine ACR normal. No microvascular or macrovascular complications. Retinal screening clear (February 2025, next due by 2027). Foot examination normal (November 2025).
2. Weight — stable at 78.3 kg, BMI 28.1. Maintained weight loss from baseline.
3. Medication tolerability — both Metformin and Empagliflozin well tolerated for over 1 year of dual therapy.

Discussed options for further A1c optimization:
- Increase Empagliflozin to 25 mg daily (additional modest A1c benefit of ~0.1–0.2%)
- Add a third agent (DPP-4 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist)
- Continue current regimen with sustained lifestyle focus

Given that A1c is near target, patient is asymptomatic, and there are no complications, agreed to continue current regimen and intensify lifestyle efforts. Will reassess at annual physical. If A1c continues to trend upward, will consider dose increase or third agent at that time.

### Plan
1. Continue Metformin 1000 mg PO BID.
2. Continue Empagliflozin 10 mg PO daily.
3. Reinforce dietary consistency and physical activity through remaining winter months.
4. Schedule annual physical for August 2026 — will include comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid panel, cardiovascular risk assessment, and statin initiation discussion (patient will be approaching age 40).
5. Repeat A1c prior to annual physical (lab requisition provided for July 2026).
6. Retinal screening — due by February 2027. Will generate ophthalmology referral at annual physical if not already scheduled.
7. Annual diabetic foot care — due November 2026.
8. Influenza vaccine — to be given at fall visit or at pharmacy.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: August 2026 for annual physical and comprehensive diabetes review
- Referrals: None at this time
