### Subjective

Chloe Wilson is a 34-year-old female teacher presenting for her annual physical examination and routine thyroid review. She was diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism approximately four years ago and has been on levothyroxine 100 mcg daily since diagnosis. She reports taking her medication each morning on an empty stomach, approximately 30 minutes before breakfast. She denies any symptoms of hypothyroidism including fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, or dry skin. She also denies symptoms suggestive of overreplacement such as palpitations, tremor, heat intolerance, or unintentional weight loss. She reports feeling well overall, with stable energy levels and good sleep. No changes in menstrual cycle; periods are regular at 28-day intervals. She is not currently trying to conceive. No new medications or supplements. She does not take calcium or iron supplements. Diet is balanced; exercises 3-4 times per week (running and yoga). Non-smoker, occasional alcohol (2-3 drinks per week). No family history changes; mother has Hashimoto's thyroiditis. No concerns today beyond routine follow-up.

## Encounter 2: 2024-09-12 — TSH Follow-up / Dose Assessment

- Date: 2024-09-12
- Time: 14:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton, ON)
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Follow-up TSH results and thyroid medication review

### Subjective

Chloe returns for a scheduled thyroid follow-up. She had bloodwork completed one week ago as arranged at her annual physical. Over the past month, she has noticed mild fatigue in the afternoons and occasional difficulty concentrating at work (she teaches grade 5). She attributes this partly to the start of the school year but wants to ensure her thyroid is adequately managed. She continues to take levothyroxine 100 mcg daily on an empty stomach in the morning. She has not missed any doses. No palpitations, tremor, or heat intolerance. No significant weight change. Sleep has been slightly shorter (6-7 hours vs her usual 7-8) due to early school start times. No new medications. She started taking a daily multivitamin (contains no iron or calcium) about two months ago. No other changes.

### Objective

- Vitals: BP 120/76 mmHg, HR 68 bpm, Temp 36.5 C
- Weight: 69.4 kg (up 1.2 kg from April)
- General: Well-appearing, mildly fatigued appearance but alert and oriented
- Thyroid: Normal size, no nodules, no tenderness

Labs (drawn 2024-09-05):
- TSH: 3.1 mIU/L (reference 0.4-4.0 mIU/L)
- Free T4: 13.8 pmol/L (reference 10.0-25.0 pmol/L)

### Assessment

1. **Primary hypothyroidism** — TSH 3.1 mIU/L, still within normal range though slightly higher than April value of 2.3. Free T4 remains normal. The mild fatigue and concentration difficulty are more likely related to lifestyle factors (sleep deprivation, start of school year stress) than undertreated hypothyroidism. No clinical indication for dose increase at this time.
2. **Mild fatigue** — likely multifactorial: reduced sleep, seasonal adjustment to work schedule. Not consistent with progressive hypothyroidism given normal TSH and free T4.

### Plan

1. Continue levothyroxine 100 mcg PO daily — no dose adjustment at this time. TSH remains within target and symptoms are better explained by lifestyle factors.
2. Discussed sleep hygiene strategies: consistent bedtime, limiting screen time before bed, aiming for 7-8 hours.
3. Confirmed multivitamin does not contain iron or calcium; acceptable to continue but advised to take it at a separate time from levothyroxine as a general precaution.
4. If fatigue persists or worsens over the next 6-8 weeks despite improved sleep, patient to call for reassessment and possible dose adjustment.
5. Recheck TSH in 6 months (around March 2025) or sooner if symptoms worsen.
6. Patient counselled that minor TSH fluctuations within the reference range are normal and do not necessarily indicate a need for dose change.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: 6 months for repeat TSH, or sooner if fatigue persists or new hypothyroid symptoms develop
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 3: 2025-01-09 — Sore Throat / Pharyngitis

- Date: 2025-01-09
- Time: 11:45
- Type: Walk-in
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton, ON)
- Practitioner: NP Sandra Fleming, MN NP-PHC (ON-NP-50312)
- Reason for visit: Sore throat x 3 days

### Subjective

Chloe presents on a walk-in basis with a 3-day history of sore throat. She describes the pain as moderate, worse with swallowing, present bilaterally. She has had associated nasal congestion, mild rhinorrhea (clear), and an intermittent dry cough. She reports feeling mildly feverish at home but did not measure her temperature. No significant fatigue beyond what she attributes to being unwell. No rash, joint pains, or eye redness. No sick contacts that she is aware of, though she notes that several students in her class have been absent with colds recently. She has been managing symptoms with acetaminophen 500 mg q6h PRN and warm salt water gargles. No dysphagia to solids or liquids. No voice changes or drooling. No history of recurrent strep throat or rheumatic fever. She continues her levothyroxine 100 mcg daily without interruption. No allergies to medications.

### Objective

- Vitals: BP 116/72 mmHg, HR 78 bpm, Temp 37.4 C, RR 16, SpO2 99% RA
- General: Mildly unwell-appearing, no respiratory distress
- HEENT: Oropharynx mildly erythematous, no tonsillar exudates, no tonsillar enlargement; uvula midline; no peritonsillar bulging; no trismus
- Neck: Bilateral anterior cervical lymph nodes mildly tender and palpable (small, mobile); no posterior cervical lymphadenopathy
- Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles
- Ears: Tympanic membranes normal bilaterally

Centor Score: 1 (anterior cervical lymphadenopathy) — low probability of Group A Streptococcus. Age modifier: 0 (age 15-44). Modified Centor: 1.

### Assessment

1. **Acute viral pharyngitis** — clinical presentation consistent with viral upper respiratory tract infection. Low Centor score; rapid strep testing not indicated per Ontario guidelines at this score. No signs of peritonsillar abscess or other complications.
2. **Primary hypothyroidism** — stable on levothyroxine, not directly relevant to today's presentation. No medication interactions to consider.

### Plan

1. Supportive care: continue acetaminophen 500 mg PO q4-6h PRN for pain and fever (max 4 g/day). May alternate with ibuprofen 400 mg PO q6h PRN with food if needed for additional relief.
2. Warm salt water gargles, throat lozenges PRN, adequate oral hydration.
3. Advised to rest and stay home from work until afebrile for 24 hours.
4. Return precautions: worsening symptoms, high fever (>38.5 C), difficulty swallowing or breathing, inability to maintain oral intake, symptoms lasting >7-10 days, or development of new rash.
5. Rapid strep test not performed today given low clinical probability. If symptoms change (development of fever, exudates, absence of cough), patient to return for reassessment.
6. No antibiotics prescribed.
7. Reminder: upcoming TSH recheck due around March 2025 per Dr. Moreau's plan — patient may book bloodwork when feeling better.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: As needed; return if symptoms worsen or fail to improve within 7-10 days
- Referrals: None

- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Annual health examination and hypothyroidism review

### Subjective

Chloe presents for her annual physical and thyroid follow-up. She reports feeling well overall. The fatigue she experienced last fall resolved after she adjusted her sleep schedule and has not recurred. Energy levels are good. She denies any hypothyroid or hyperthyroid symptoms: no weight gain or loss, no cold or heat intolerance, no constipation, no hair changes, no palpitations, no tremor. Mood is stable and positive. Menstrual cycles remain regular at 28-29 days. She has been considering starting a family within the next 1-2 years and would like to discuss preconception planning. She continues levothyroxine 100 mcg daily, taken on empty stomach in the morning. No new medications or supplements; she stopped the multivitamin as she felt it was unnecessary. She recovered fully from the pharyngitis in January within a week. No other illnesses or ER visits since last seen. Exercising regularly (running 3x/week, yoga 2x/week). Non-smoker. Alcohol reduced to 1-2 drinks per week. No drug use. Family history unchanged.

### Objective

- Vitals: BP 114/70 mmHg, HR 70 bpm, Temp 36.5 C, RR 14, SpO2 99% RA
- Height: 170 cm
- Weight: 69.0 kg
- BMI: 23.9 kg/m2
- General: Well-appearing, healthy, no acute distress
- HEENT: Thyroid normal in size, no nodules, non-tender; oropharynx clear; no lymphadenopathy

- Extremities: No edema, reflexes 2+ and symmetric
- Skin: Normal turgor, no dryness

Labs (fasting, drawn 2025-05-01):
- TSH: 2.1 mIU/L (reference 0.4-4.0 mIU/L)
- Free T4: 15.6 pmol/L (reference 10.0-25.0 pmol/L)
- CBC: WBC 5.8, Hgb 140 g/L, Plt 232 — within normal limits
- Ferritin: 58 ug/L (reference 12-150 ug/L)
- Fasting glucose: 4.6 mmol/L
- Lipid panel: Total cholesterol 4.4, LDL 2.3, HDL 1.7, TG 0.9 — all within normal limits
- 25-OH Vitamin D: 72 nmol/L (reference >75 nmol/L is optimal)

### Assessment

1. **Primary hypothyroidism** — well controlled. TSH 2.1 mIU/L, ideal range. Clinically euthyroid. Current dose of levothyroxine 100 mcg daily is appropriate. Important to note: if patient becomes pregnant, levothyroxine dose will likely need to be increased by approximately 25-50% early in pregnancy, with TSH target <2.5 mIU/L in first trimester.
2. **Preconception counselling** — patient is considering pregnancy in the next 1-2 years. Thyroid function is well controlled, which is reassuring. Ferritin and CBC are adequate. Vitamin D is borderline insufficient.
3. **Vitamin D insufficiency** — 25-OH Vitamin D 72 nmol/L, slightly below optimal threshold of 75. Common in Hamilton latitude, particularly by end of winter/early spring.
4. **Routine health maintenance** — up to date. Pap smear not due (last done April 2024, next due 2027 per Ontario screening interval). All other screening parameters normal.

### Plan

1. Continue levothyroxine 100 mcg PO daily. No dose change required.
2. **Preconception planning discussed:**
   - Start folic acid 1 mg PO daily now, at least 3 months before attempting conception.
   - When pregnancy confirmed, contact clinic immediately for early TSH check (within first 4 weeks). Levothyroxine dose will likely be increased empirically by 25-30%.
   - Target TSH in pregnancy: <2.5 mIU/L in first trimester, <3.0 mIU/L in second and third trimesters.
   - Ensure rubella immunity — checked previous records, immune per childhood vaccination and prior serology.
   - Reviewed general preconception recommendations: minimize alcohol, continue exercise, balanced diet.
3. Vitamin D3 1000 IU PO daily to optimize levels; recheck in 3-6 months.
4. Continue current exercise and dietary habits.
5. Next TSH recheck in 6 months, or sooner if attempting conception or if symptoms arise.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: 6 months for thyroid recheck with NP; sooner if pregnancy confirmed or symptoms develop
- Referrals: None

- Practitioner: NP Sandra Fleming, MN NP-PHC (ON-NP-50312)
- Reason for visit: Routine TSH follow-up and levothyroxine prescription renewal

### Subjective

Chloe presents for a routine thyroid check and medication renewal. She continues to feel well with no complaints. Energy is good, mood is stable, sleep is adequate at 7-8 hours nightly. No symptoms of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Weight has been stable. She has been taking folic acid 1 mg daily as recommended by Dr. Moreau and vitamin D3 1000 IU daily. She is still considering pregnancy but has not actively started trying yet — she and her partner are planning to begin trying in spring 2026. She continues levothyroxine 100 mcg daily, taken on empty stomach each morning 30-45 minutes before eating. She takes her folic acid and vitamin D with breakfast, well separated from the levothyroxine. She has not had any intercurrent illnesses or visits elsewhere since May. No new medications or changes. No allergies. She notes she is running low on her levothyroxine prescription and will need a renewal.

### Objective

- Vitals: BP 116/72 mmHg, HR 74 bpm, Temp 36.6 C
- Weight: 69.4 kg
- General: Well-appearing, no acute distress
- Thyroid: Normal to palpation, no nodules, no tenderness
- Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm
- Skin: Normal, no dryness or edema

Labs (drawn 2025-11-13):
- TSH: 2.3 mIU/L (reference 0.4-4.0 mIU/L)
- Free T4: 15.0 pmol/L (reference 10.0-25.0 pmol/L)
- 25-OH Vitamin D: 82 nmol/L (reference >75 nmol/L is optimal)

### Assessment

1. **Primary hypothyroidism** — stable and well controlled on levothyroxine 100 mcg daily. TSH 2.3 mIU/L, within target. Free T4 normal. No dose change indicated. Patient remains clinically euthyroid.
2. **Preconception status** — patient planning to conceive spring 2026. Thyroid function is optimally controlled for conception (TSH <2.5). Folic acid supplementation in place. Vitamin D has improved to optimal range at 82 nmol/L.
3. **Vitamin D** — now in optimal range with supplementation. Continue current dose through winter months.

### Plan

1. **Levothyroxine 100 mcg PO daily** — prescription renewed for 12 months (refills x3, 90-day supply each). Continue taking on empty stomach, 30-60 minutes before food. Avoid concurrent calcium, iron, or antacids.
2. Continue folic acid 1 mg PO daily in preparation for planned pregnancy.
3. Continue vitamin D3 1000 IU PO daily; reassess in spring.
4. Reiterated preconception thyroid plan: when pregnancy is confirmed, patient should call the clinic promptly. Early TSH draw will be arranged and levothyroxine dose will likely be increased empirically. First trimester TSH target is <2.5 mIU/L.
5. Reviewed signs to watch for that may indicate thyroid changes: unusual fatigue, weight changes, mood changes, menstrual irregularity.
6. Results and plan communicated to Dr. Moreau via EMR for continuity.
7. Next routine TSH check in 6 months (approximately May 2026), or sooner if pregnancy confirmed.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: 6 months (May 2026) for annual physical and TSH recheck with Dr. Moreau, or sooner if pregnancy confirmed
- Referrals: None
