## Encounter 1: 2024-05-14 — Annual Well-Child Visit / Eczema Review

- Date: 2024-05-14
- Time: 10:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Markham-Stouffville Family Health Team (377 Church St, Suite 200, Markham, ON)
- Practitioner: Dr. Kevin Zhao, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-61038)
- Reason for visit: Annual well-child examination and atopic dermatitis review

### Subjective

Maya Chen is a 7-year-old female presenting with her mother, Mrs. Linda Chen, for her annual well-child visit and eczema review. Mother reports that Maya has been doing well overall. Her atopic dermatitis was diagnosed at age 4 and has remained mild, primarily affecting the antecubital and popliteal fossae. Mother states the eczema has been reasonably well controlled through the winter with regular moisturizing (Cerave cream applied twice daily) and intermittent use of hydrocortisone 1% cream for flares, typically 2-3 times per month for a few days at a time. The last noticeable flare was approximately six weeks ago, with mild redness and itching behind the knees that resolved within four days of hydrocortisone application. Maya has been swimming recreationally once per week at the Markham Pan Am Centre since September. Mother notes that the chlorinated pool water occasionally causes mild dryness and itching afterward, but rinsing promptly after swimming and applying moisturizer has helped. No open or weeping lesions. No skin infections. No new rashes. Maya sleeps well and the eczema does not disrupt her sleep. Appetite is good. Bowel and bladder habits normal. She is in grade 2, doing well academically and socially. No behavioural concerns. No headaches, vision complaints, or hearing concerns. No allergies to foods, medications, or environmental triggers identified. No history of asthma or allergic rhinitis. Immunizations are up to date per Ontario publicly funded schedule; she received her school-entry boosters (DTaP-IPV and MMR) prior to starting grade 1. Family history: mother has mild seasonal allergic rhinitis; father is well. No siblings. No medications other than hydrocortisone 1% cream PRN and Cerave moisturizer.

### Objective

- Musculoskeletal: Normal gait, spine straight, no scoliosis detected on forward bend test
- Skin: Mild xerosis noted in bilateral antecubital fossae and popliteal fossae without active erythema, lichenification, or excoriations. No vesicles, no crusting, no secondary infection. Remainder of skin is clear. No concerning nevi.
- Neurological: Age-appropriate tone, strength, and coordination
- Development: Age-appropriate speech, social interaction, and fine/gross motor skills per observation and maternal report

### Assessment

1. **Atopic dermatitis, mild** — well controlled on current regimen of regular emollient use and intermittent low-potency topical corticosteroid. No signs of active flare today. Skin is mildly dry in typical flexural distribution but no active eczema. No evidence of secondary bacterial infection. No features suggestive of progression to moderate disease.
2. **Well-child examination** — growth parameters tracking at 50th percentile for both height and weight, appropriate BMI. Vision and hearing screening normal. Development appropriate for age. Immunizations up to date per Ontario schedule. No concerns identified.
3. **Recreational swimming and skin management** — chlorine exposure is a recognized irritant for atopic skin. Current post-swim care routine appears effective.

### Plan

1. Continue Cerave moisturizing cream applied liberally at least twice daily, especially after bathing and swimming. Emollient use is the cornerstone of eczema management.
2. Continue hydrocortisone 1% cream applied to affected areas twice daily during flares for up to 7 days at a time. If a flare does not improve within 7 days, return for reassessment.
3. Reviewed swimming skin care: rinse with fresh water immediately after exiting the pool, pat dry gently (avoid rubbing), and apply moisturizer within 3 minutes of rinsing. Consider applying a thin layer of petroleum jelly or moisturizer to vulnerable areas before entering the pool as a barrier.
4. Avoid known irritants: fragranced soaps, bubble baths, fabric softeners. Use mild, fragrance-free cleansers (e.g., Cerave or Cetaphil wash).
5. Short, lukewarm baths preferred over hot baths; apply moisturizer immediately after.
6. Discussed signs of skin infection to watch for: increased redness, warmth, swelling, honey-coloured crusting, or pustules — return promptly if these develop.
7. No referral to dermatology needed at this time given mild, well-controlled disease.
8. Growth plotted on WHO growth chart; continue monitoring at annual visits.
9. Next immunization due: Hepatitis B series (grade 7 school-based program) — no vaccines required today.
10. Anticipatory guidance provided: sun safety, water safety and swimming supervision, nutrition, screen time limits, physical activity goals (60 minutes daily), dental hygiene, and seatbelt/booster seat use.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: 12 months for next annual well-child visit, or sooner if eczema worsens or concerns arise
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 2: 2024-09-19 — Eczema Flare Post-Swimming Season

- Date: 2024-09-19
- Time: 14:15
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Markham-Stouffville Family Health Team (377 Church St, Suite 200, Markham, ON)
- Practitioner: Dr. Kevin Zhao, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-61038)
- Reason for visit: Eczema flare following increased summer swimming

### Subjective

Maya presents with her mother for assessment of an eczema flare. Mother reports that Maya attended a summer swimming camp at the Markham Pan Am Centre in July and August, swimming 4-5 days per week for approximately 6 weeks. During the first few weeks, her skin remained manageable with their usual routine of rinsing after swimming and applying moisturizer. However, by mid-August, Maya developed persistent redness and itching in the antecubital fossae, popliteal fossae, and now also on her wrists and dorsal hands bilaterally, which are areas that were not previously affected. Mother has been applying hydrocortisone 1% cream twice daily for the past three weeks with only partial improvement. Maya has been scratching, particularly at night, and mother has noticed some disrupted sleep over the past week (waking once or twice, scratching). No bleeding, oozing, or crusting observed. No fever. No pustules. Mother has continued twice-daily Cerave moisturizer application. Swimming camp ended two weeks ago and Maya has not returned to the pool since. The rash has improved slightly since stopping swimming but has not fully resolved. No new soaps, detergents, or clothing. No dietary changes. No new pets. Maya is otherwise well and started grade 3 in September with no issues. No URI or other illness symptoms.

### Objective

- Vitals: HR 84 bpm, Temp 36.4 C, RR 18, SpO2 99% RA
- Weight: 27.8 kg
- General: Well-appearing child, mild visible excoriations on wrists, otherwise comfortable
- Skin:
  - Bilateral antecubital fossae: erythematous, mildly lichenified plaques with fine scaling and scattered excoriations. No vesicles, no crusting, no exudate.
  - Bilateral popliteal fossae: erythematous patches with mild scaling, less pronounced than antecubital fossae. Scattered linear excoriations from scratching.
  - Bilateral wrists and dorsal hands: new erythematous, mildly scaling patches. Dry, rough texture. No lichenification.
  - No honey-coloured crusting, no pustules, no warmth or swelling to suggest secondary infection.
  - SCORAD estimate: approximately 20-25 (mild-to-moderate range)
- Nails: Short, no signs of fungal infection
- Remainder of examination: unremarkable

### Assessment

1. **Atopic dermatitis flare, mild-to-moderate** — worsened in the context of increased and prolonged chlorine exposure during summer swimming camp. New involvement of wrists and dorsal hands. Partial response to hydrocortisone 1% cream over three weeks, indicating that this low-potency steroid is insufficient for the current flare. No signs of secondary bacterial infection. Sleep mildly disrupted by pruritus.
2. **Chlorine as an identified irritant trigger** — frequent chlorinated pool exposure was the clear precipitating factor. The skin barrier disruption from daily chlorine contact led to disease extension beyond usual flexural distribution.

### Plan

1. **Step up topical corticosteroid**: Prescribe hydrocortisone valerate 0.2% cream (medium-potency, Group V) — apply a thin layer to all actively affected areas (antecubital fossae, popliteal fossae, wrists, dorsal hands) twice daily for 14 days, then step down to hydrocortisone 1% cream twice daily for an additional 7 days, then discontinue and resume PRN use of hydrocortisone 1% for future flares. Counsel mother on appropriate fingertip unit dosing.
2. Continue Cerave moisturizing cream applied liberally at least twice daily and after any water exposure. Increase frequency to 3-4 times daily during active flare if possible.
3. **Itch management**: Oral diphenhydramine 12.5 mg (half teaspoon of liquid) PO at bedtime PRN for 1-2 weeks to help with nighttime pruritus and sleep disruption. Reviewed that this is for short-term use only and does not treat the underlying eczema. Keep fingernails trimmed short to minimize excoriation damage.
4. **Swimming recommendations discussed**: When Maya returns to swimming, limit sessions to 2-3 times per week rather than daily. Apply petroleum jelly or Aquaphor as a barrier to eczema-prone areas before entering the pool. Rinse immediately after swimming with lukewarm fresh water and a gentle cleanser, pat dry, and apply moisturizer within 3 minutes. If eczema is actively flaring, avoid the pool until the flare is controlled.
5. Reviewed proper topical steroid use: apply to affected skin only, not to unaffected areas; do not use medium-potency steroid on face, groin, or axillae; apply moisturizer at least 15-20 minutes before or after steroid application.
6. Return in 3-4 weeks for reassessment. If the flare has not improved significantly within 2 weeks of the medium-potency steroid, call the clinic rather than waiting for the scheduled visit.
7. If recurrent flares with swimming or if disease severity increases, will consider referral to pediatric dermatology.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: 3-4 weeks for flare reassessment; phone call in 2 weeks if not improving
- Referrals: None at this time

## Encounter 3: 2025-05-13 — Annual Well-Child Visit / Eczema Management Review

- Date: 2025-05-13
- Time: 09:45
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Markham-Stouffville Family Health Team (377 Church St, Suite 200, Markham, ON)
- Practitioner: Dr. Kevin Zhao, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-61038)
- Reason for visit: Annual well-child examination and eczema management review

### Subjective

Maya presents with her mother for her annual well-child visit and eczema follow-up. Mother reports that the eczema flare from last September resolved well after the two-week course of hydrocortisone valerate 0.2% cream. The affected areas on the wrists and dorsal hands cleared fully and have not recurred. The antecubital and popliteal fossae returned to their baseline mild dryness. Maya resumed swimming once weekly in October and has continued through the winter and spring without significant flares. Mother attributes the improvement to applying petroleum jelly before swimming, rinsing immediately afterward, and limiting pool sessions to once per week. She has needed the hydrocortisone 1% cream only 3-4 times since November, each for brief periods of 2-3 days. The diphenhydramine at bedtime was used for about one week last September and then discontinued; sleep has been normal since. No nighttime itching. No new areas of involvement. No skin infections. No oozing, crusting, or bleeding.

Maya is in grade 3 and doing well. She enjoys swimming and has also joined a school running club. Mother has no concerns about her behaviour, mood, or social interactions. Appetite is good and she eats a varied diet. Bowel and bladder habits are normal. No headaches. No vision or hearing complaints. No recurrent infections. She had a mild cold in February 2025 that resolved on its own within a few days. No other illnesses or visits since September. No allergies. No new medications. Immunizations remain up to date. Family history unchanged.

### Objective

- Vitals: BP 98/60 mmHg, HR 82 bpm, Temp 36.6 C, RR 16, SpO2 99% RA
- Height: 137.0 cm (63rd percentile for age; gained 11.6 cm since May 2024)
- Weight: 32.0 kg (60th percentile for age)
- BMI: 17.0 kg/m2 (56th percentile for age)
- General: Well-appearing, cheerful, cooperative child in no distress
- HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic; pupils equal and reactive; TMs clear bilaterally with normal landmarks; oropharynx clear; dentition good, no caries noted; mild nasal turbinate congestion bilaterally (seasonal, no active rhinorrhea)
- Vision screening: Snellen 20/20 bilaterally
- Hearing screening: Pass bilaterally (pure tone audiometry at 1000 Hz and 4000 Hz, 25 dB)
- Neck: Supple, no lymphadenopathy
- Cardiovascular: S1S2 normal, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs
- Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, normal bowel sounds
- Musculoskeletal: Normal gait, spine straight, negative Adams forward bend test
- Skin: Mild xerosis in bilateral antecubital fossae and popliteal fossae, consistent with baseline atopic dermatitis. No erythema, no active inflammation, no lichenification, no excoriations. Wrists and dorsal hands are clear. No lesions elsewhere. No concerning nevi.
- Neurological: Age-appropriate tone, strength, and coordination; tandem gait normal
- Development: Age-appropriate in all domains; reading at grade level per mother's report; social interactions and peer relationships appropriate

### Assessment

1. **Atopic dermatitis, mild** — stable and well controlled. The flare from increased chlorine exposure last summer has fully resolved. Disease is back to baseline mild xerosis in flexural areas. Current management strategy is effective: regular emollient, avoidance of excess chlorine exposure, pre-swim barrier application, and intermittent hydrocortisone 1% PRN. No need for escalation of therapy.
2. **Well-child examination, age 9** — growth is excellent. Height velocity of 11.6 cm/year is appropriate for pre-pubertal growth (typically 5-7 cm/year expected, with early pubertal acceleration beginning in girls around age 8-10). Height and weight remain proportional with a healthy BMI. Vision and hearing screening normal. Development appropriate for age. Immunizations up to date. No Tanner staging performed today; mother declines and prefers to defer to next year, which is acceptable given the child's age.
3. **Physical activity** — age-appropriate and commendable. Swimming once weekly and running club provide good cardiovascular fitness. No musculoskeletal concerns.

### Plan

1. Continue Cerave moisturizing cream at least twice daily as maintenance therapy. This is the single most important measure in atopic dermatitis management.
2. Continue hydrocortisone 1% cream applied twice daily to flare areas PRN for up to 7 days. Retain hydrocortisone valerate 0.2% cream prescription for use if a flare does not respond to hydrocortisone 1% within one week — mother still has an adequate supply from the September prescription.
3. Continue pre-swim skin protection routine: petroleum jelly to eczema-prone areas before swimming, rinse immediately after, gentle cleanser, and prompt moisturizer application.
4. Anticipatory guidance provided:
   - Reviewed age-appropriate puberty education; provided the CPS (Canadian Paediatric Society) parent handout on puberty.
   - Nutrition: adequate calcium and vitamin D intake for bone health during the upcoming growth spurt (encourage dairy, fortified alternatives; consider vitamin D supplementation 600 IU daily during winter months).
   - Screen time: limit recreational screen time to no more than 2 hours daily.
   - Internet safety: reviewed age-appropriate online safety with mother given increasing device use at school and home.
   - Physical activity: continue goal of 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity daily.
   - Sun protection: sunscreen SPF 30+ for outdoor activities, reapply every 2 hours; note that sunscreen should be applied after moisturizer and before any topical steroids if used on the same day.
   - Mental health check-in: Maya reports feeling happy at school and at home. No bullying or social concerns.
5. Growth plotted on WHO growth charts and reviewed with mother. Growth trajectory is healthy and consistent.
6. Next immunization: Hepatitis B series will be administered through the school-based program in grade 7 (approximately 2028). No vaccines required today.
7. Discussed potential for eczema to improve with age — many children see significant improvement or resolution by adolescence, though some continue to have flares into adulthood. Encouraged continued adherence to skin care routine.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: 12 months for next annual well-child visit, or sooner if eczema worsens or new health concerns arise
- Referrals: None
