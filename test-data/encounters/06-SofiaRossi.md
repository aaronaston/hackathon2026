## Encounter 1: 2024-04-18 — Annual Physical Examination / Migraine Review

- Date: 2024-04-18
- Time: 10:15
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Kitchener-Waterloo Family Health Team, 200 King St W, Suite 400, Kitchener, ON
- Practitioner: Dr. Robert Osei, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-65189)
- Reason for visit: Annual health examination; migraine follow-up

### Subjective

Sofia presents for her annual physical. She reports generally feeling well. She has been experiencing episodic migraines since approximately age 21, diagnosed as migraine without aura. Over the past year she estimates 2-3 migraines per month, each lasting 6-12 hours if untreated. Typical presentation is unilateral throbbing headache (predominantly right-sided), associated with photophobia, phonophobia, and occasional nausea. No visual aura, no motor or sensory prodrome.

She identifies shift work and disrupted sleep as her primary triggers. She works rotating shifts at a warehouse logistics company (days and evenings, occasionally overnights). Stress and skipped meals are secondary triggers. She does not identify any consistent dietary triggers. She keeps an informal migraine diary on her phone.

She uses rizatriptan 10 mg at onset, which she finds effective within 90 minutes for most attacks. She takes naproxen 500 mg for milder headaches or tension-type episodes. She uses rizatriptan approximately 2-3 times per month and naproxen approximately 3-4 times per month. No medication overuse pattern at present.

She denies any new medical concerns. No chest pain, shortness of breath, change in bowel habits, urinary symptoms, or mood concerns. Last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago, regular 28-day cycles. She uses combined oral contraceptive (Alesse) without issues. No smoking, occasional alcohol (1-2 drinks socially on weekends), no recreational drugs.

She notes her penicillin allergy (rash in childhood, approximately age 8 — generalized maculopapular rash, no anaphylaxis).

### Objective

- Vitals: BP 116/72 mmHg, HR 68 bpm, Temp 36.5 C, RR 14, SpO2 99% RA
- Weight: 63.0 kg, Height: 168 cm, BMI: 22.3
- General: Well-appearing, no acute distress
- HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils equal, round, reactive to light. Fundi normal bilaterally. TMs clear. Oropharynx clear, no lymphadenopathy
- Neck: Supple, no thyromegaly, no cervical lymphadenopathy. Mild bilateral trapezius muscle tension
- Cardiovascular: S1 S2 normal, no murmurs, regular rate and rhythm
- Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly, normal bowel sounds
- Neurological: Cranial nerves II-XII intact. Motor 5/5 in all extremities. Sensation intact to light touch. DTRs 2+ and symmetric. Coordination normal. Gait normal
- Skin: No rashes, no lesions of concern
- Mental health screening: PHQ-2 score 1/6 (negative)

### Assessment

1. **Migraine without aura, episodic** — Reasonably well-controlled with current PRN approach. Frequency 2-3/month is below the threshold for prophylaxis consideration (typically >4/month). Rizatriptan effective as abortive therapy. No medication overuse concern at present.
2. **Annual health examination** — No acute concerns. Routine screening up to date. Due for Pap test (last 2021, due 2024 per Ontario guidelines).
3. **Penicillin allergy** — Documented: rash (childhood). Low risk for true IgE-mediated allergy given presentation, but will continue to avoid penicillins and amoxicillin pending any formal allergy assessment if needed.

### Plan

1. Continue rizatriptan 10 mg PO PRN at migraine onset (max 2 doses/24h). Continue naproxen 500 mg PO PRN for milder headaches.
2. Migraine diary: Encouraged to continue tracking frequency, duration, triggers, and medication use. Discussed sleep hygiene strategies given shift work constraints — maintain consistent wake time on days off where possible, dark/quiet sleep environment, avoid screens 1 hour before sleep.
3. Discussed that if migraine frequency increases to >4/month or significant functional impairment occurs, prophylactic therapy should be considered.
4. Pap test: Booked for next visit or separate appointment with nurse.
5. Routine bloodwork ordered: CBC, fasting glucose, lipid panel, TSH.
6. Continue Alesse OCP. Reviewed that migraine without aura is not a contraindication to combined OCP use.
7. OHIP-covered annual preventive visit.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: 1 year for annual physical, or sooner if migraine frequency changes
- Referrals: None at this time

## Encounter 2: 2024-08-09 — Walk-in Visit for Acute Migraine

- Date: 2024-08-09
- Time: 14:40
- Type: Walk-in
- Setting: Walk-in Clinic
- Organization: Dundas Walk-in Clinic, 10 King St W, Dundas, ON
- Practitioner: Dr. Martin Chou, MD CCFP
- Reason for visit: Acute migraine, unresponsive to usual abortive therapy

### Subjective

Sofia presents to the walk-in clinic with a severe migraine that began approximately 8 hours ago (onset ~06:30 this morning). She woke from sleep with right-sided throbbing headache, rated 8/10 at its worst. Associated nausea (has vomited once), significant photophobia, and phonophobia. She took rizatriptan 10 mg at onset (~06:45) which provided minimal relief. She took naproxen 500 mg at 10:00. She tried a second rizatriptan 10 mg at approximately 12:30 (within 24-hour dosing guidelines). Despite this, the headache has only reduced to 6/10.

She reports she has been on a stretch of overnight shifts for the past two weeks and has been sleeping poorly — averaging 4-5 hours of fragmented sleep per day. She also reports high stress at work related to a deadline. She has not eaten since last evening due to nausea.

She denies fever, neck stiffness, worst headache of life, new neurological symptoms, visual changes beyond her usual photophobia, or recent head trauma. This headache is typical in character for her migraines, but more severe and prolonged than usual.

She confirms her allergy to penicillin (rash). Her family physician is Dr. Robert Osei at KW Family Health Team.

### Objective

- Vitals: BP 128/78 mmHg, HR 82 bpm, Temp 36.6 C, RR 16, SpO2 99% RA
- General: Appears uncomfortable, lying on exam bed with eyes closed. Wearing sunglasses indoors. Quiet voice.
- HEENT: No signs of trauma. Pupils equal and reactive. No papilledema on fundoscopy. Temporal arteries non-tender, non-thickened. No sinus tenderness.
- Neck: Supple, full range of motion, no meningismus. Bilateral trapezius and cervical paraspinal muscle tightness.
- Neurological: Alert, oriented x3. Cranial nerves II-XII grossly intact. Motor 5/5 all extremities. No focal deficits. Gait not formally tested (patient prefers to remain still).

### Assessment

1. **Acute migraine without aura, status migrainosus** — Prolonged migraine attack (>8 hours) refractory to patient's usual abortive regimen (rizatriptan x2, naproxen x1). Likely precipitated by significant sleep deprivation from rotating shift work and psychosocial stress. No red flags for secondary headache.

### Plan

1. IV access established. Administered:
   - Metoclopramide 10 mg IV (antiemetic + migraine adjunct)
   - Ketorolac 30 mg IV (NSAID — not contraindicated by penicillin allergy)
   - Normal saline 500 mL IV bolus (for dehydration from nausea/vomiting and poor oral intake)
2. Dimmed lights in exam room. Patient rested in quiet room for approximately 45 minutes post-infusion.
3. Reassessed at 45 minutes: Headache improved to 3/10. Nausea resolved. Tolerating oral fluids.
4. Discharge instructions: Rest at home, continue hydration, avoid driving for remainder of day, may take naproxen 500 mg in 6 hours if needed. Do not take additional rizatriptan today.
5. Advised to contact her family physician to discuss migraine management given prolonged attack and sleep disruption pattern. If migraines are becoming more frequent, prophylactic options may be warranted.
6. Advised on sleep hygiene, particularly around shift transitions. Discussed the strong evidence linking sleep deprivation to migraine threshold lowering.
7. Return precautions: Return to ED if headache returns with severe intensity, new neurological symptoms, fever, neck stiffness, or worst headache of life.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: With family physician Dr. Robert Osei within 2-4 weeks to review migraine management
- Referrals: None; walk-in clinic note to be sent to Dr. Osei's office via fax

## Encounter 3: 2024-11-14 — FP Follow-up: Migraine Frequency Increasing

- Date: 2024-11-14
- Time: 09:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Kitchener-Waterloo Family Health Team, 200 King St W, Suite 400, Kitchener, ON
- Practitioner: Dr. Robert Osei, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-65189)
- Reason for visit: Follow-up migraine management; increasing frequency

### Subjective

Sofia presents for follow-up, specifically to discuss her migraine frequency. She reports that since the summer, her migraines have been more frequent. Reviewing her migraine diary on her phone:

- June 2024: 3 migraines
- July 2024: 4 migraines
- August 2024: 5 migraines (including the prolonged attack treated at Dundas Walk-in)
- September 2024: 5 migraines
- October 2024: 4 migraines
- November (to date): 2 migraines

She notes the increase coincided with taking on more overnight shifts. Her employer moved to a 3-week rotating schedule (days, evenings, overnights) starting in June. She feels her sleep has been significantly disrupted since. She has been using rizatriptan approximately 4-5 times per month and naproxen approximately 5-6 times per month.

Individual migraines remain typical in character: unilateral throbbing, photophobia, phonophobia, nausea. Duration 4-12 hours with treatment. Rizatriptan remains effective for most attacks when taken early, but she reports 1-2 attacks per month where rizatriptan only partially works.

She received the walk-in clinic note from August. She understands the recommendation to consider prophylaxis.

She denies any new symptoms. Mood is slightly lower — she feels frustrated by the headache burden and its impact on work reliability. PHQ-2: "Little interest or pleasure" — 1 (several days); "Feeling down, depressed" — 1 (several days). Score 2/6 (negative, but will monitor).

Sleep: averaging 5-6 hours on shift transition days, 7 hours on stable schedule days. No formal sleep disorder symptoms (no snoring, no witnessed apneas, no excessive daytime sleepiness beyond what she attributes to shift work).

Continues Alesse OCP without concern. No other new medications or supplements.

### Objective

- Vitals: BP 118/74 mmHg, HR 70 bpm, Temp 36.4 C
- Weight: 63.5 kg
- General: Well-appearing, no acute distress
- Neurological: Brief focused exam — cranial nerves intact, no focal deficits. Bilateral trapezius tension on palpation.
- Migraine diary review: Confirmed 4-5 migraines/month for past 4 months. Acute medication use averaging 9-11 doses/month (rizatriptan + naproxen combined).
- Bloodwork from April 2024: CBC normal, fasting glucose 4.8 mmol/L, lipid panel normal, TSH 2.1 mIU/L (normal).

### Assessment

1. **Migraine without aura, increasing frequency** — Now meeting criteria for consideration of prophylactic therapy (>4 migraines/month sustained over 4+ months). Triggers primarily related to shift work and sleep disruption. Acute medication use is approaching but not yet at medication overuse headache threshold (typically >10 triptan days/month or >15 NSAID days/month). Important to intervene before this develops.
2. **Shift work-related sleep disruption** — Primary modifiable trigger. Occupational accommodation may be beneficial but may not be feasible.
3. **Mood** — PHQ-2 borderline. Will monitor. Migraine burden likely contributing.

### Plan

1. **Prophylactic therapy discussion:** Reviewed options with patient:
   - First-line options: Amitriptyline (low dose), propranolol, topiramate.
   - Discussed that amitriptyline 10 mg PO qHS has the advantage of also promoting sleep, which may be particularly beneficial given her shift work and sleep disruption. Common side effects: drowsiness (may be beneficial), dry mouth, weight gain (usually minimal at low dose).
   - Patient agreeable to trial of amitriptyline.
2. **Start amitriptyline 10 mg PO qHS.** Take at bedtime (or before main sleep period on overnight shifts). Titrate to 25 mg after 2 weeks if tolerated and needed. Goal: reduce migraine frequency by at least 50%.
3. Continue rizatriptan 10 mg PO PRN for acute attacks. Continue naproxen 500 mg PO PRN. Advised to track all acute medication use carefully to avoid medication overuse.
4. Migraine diary: Continue. Track prophylactic medication adherence and any side effects.
5. Sleep hygiene: Reinforced strategies. Provided printed handout on shift work sleep strategies. Discussed whether she could discuss with employer about reducing overnight shift frequency — patient says she will explore this.
6. Mood: Will reassess at next visit. If worsening, consider PHQ-9 and further intervention.
7. Follow-up in 3-4 months to assess prophylaxis response. If insufficient response or poor tolerability, consider alternative prophylaxis or neurology referral.
8. Continue Alesse OCP (migraine without aura — no contraindication to estrogen-containing OCP).

### Disposition

- Follow-up: 3-4 months (target February/March 2025) to assess amitriptyline efficacy
- Referrals: None at this time; neurology referral (Dr. Brian Szabo, Hamilton General Hospital) to be considered if prophylaxis fails

---

## Encounter 4: 2025-04-03 — FP Follow-up: Migraine Management Review

- Date: 2025-04-03
- Time: 14:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Kitchener-Waterloo Family Health Team, 200 King St W, Suite 400, Kitchener, ON
- Practitioner: Dr. Robert Osei, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-65189)
- Reason for visit: Follow-up migraine prophylaxis; amitriptyline trial review

### Subjective

Sofia returns for migraine prophylaxis follow-up. She has been on amitriptyline for approximately 4.5 months. She titrated to 25 mg PO qHS after 2 weeks as instructed and has remained on that dose.

Migraine diary review:
- December 2024: 3 migraines
- January 2025: 2 migraines
- February 2025: 2 migraines
- March 2025: 2 migraines

She is pleased with the improvement. Prior to amitriptyline she was averaging 4-5 migraines/month; now averaging 2-3/month. This represents approximately a 50% reduction in frequency. Rizatriptan use has decreased to 2-3 times/month. Naproxen use decreased to 2-3 times/month.

She reports the migraines that do occur are somewhat less severe and shorter in duration (typically 3-6 hours with treatment vs. 6-12 hours previously).

Side effects of amitriptyline: She experienced some morning grogginess for the first 2-3 weeks, which resolved. She reports mild dry mouth, which she manages with increased water intake. She has gained approximately 1 kg since starting (she attributes some of this to holiday season). No constipation, urinary retention, or cardiac symptoms. She finds the mild sedative effect helpful for sleep on shift transition days.

She was able to negotiate with her employer to reduce overnight shifts from every third week to every fourth week. She feels this has helped her sleep quality.

Mood has improved. She feels more in control of her migraines and less frustrated. PHQ-2: 0/6 (negative).

She completed her Pap test in January 2025 — results normal (she was notified by the office).

No other new concerns. Continues Alesse OCP.

### Objective

- Vitals: BP 114/70 mmHg, HR 66 bpm, Temp 36.5 C
- Weight: 64.0 kg (up 1 kg from November; BMI 22.7)
- General: Well-appearing, bright affect, no acute distress
- Neurological: Focused exam — cranial nerves intact, no focal deficits. Trapezius tension improved compared to previous visits.
- Migraine diary: Confirmed ~2-3 migraines/month over past 4 months. Acute medication use approximately 4-6 doses/month total.

### Assessment

1. **Migraine without aura, on prophylaxis** — Good response to amitriptyline 25 mg qHS. Approximately 50% reduction in migraine frequency achieved (from 4-5/month to 2-3/month). Severity and duration also improved. Acute medication use well within safe limits. Side effects minimal and tolerable.
2. **Shift work sleep disruption** — Improved with reduced overnight frequency and amitriptyline's sedative benefit. Ongoing but better managed.
3. **Mood** — Improved. No concerns at this time.

### Plan

1. **Continue amitriptyline 25 mg PO qHS.** Medication is effective and well-tolerated. No indication to change dose at this time. Could consider titration to 50 mg if frequency increases again, but not needed now.
2. Continue rizatriptan 10 mg PO PRN and naproxen 500 mg PO PRN for acute attacks.
3. Continue migraine diary.
4. Weight: Monitor. Advised on continued activity and balanced nutrition. Weight gain is minimal and not clinically significant at this point.
5. Sleep hygiene: Continue current strategies. Commended patient on employer negotiation for reduced overnight shifts.
6. Continue Alesse OCP.
7. Next annual physical due October 2025 — will book closer to that date.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: 6 months (annual physical, October 2025) or sooner if migraine pattern changes
- Referrals: None required — prophylaxis is effective; neurology referral deferred

## Encounter 5: 2025-10-23 — Annual Physical Examination / Migraine Review

- Date: 2025-10-23
- Time: 11:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Kitchener-Waterloo Family Health Team, 200 King St W, Suite 400, Kitchener, ON
- Practitioner: Dr. Robert Osei, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-65189)
- Reason for visit: Annual health examination; migraine prophylaxis review

### Subjective

Sofia presents for her annual physical. She continues to do well overall.

Migraine update: She has been on amitriptyline 25 mg qHS for approximately 11 months. Migraine diary summary:

- April-October 2025: Averaging 1-2 migraines/month. Several months she had only 1 migraine. She is very satisfied with this level of control.
- Rizatriptan use: 1-2 times/month. Naproxen use: 1-2 times/month. Well below any overuse threshold.
- Migraines are shorter (typically 2-4 hours with early rizatriptan) and less severe (typically 5-6/10 at peak).

She asks about the possibility of eventually discontinuing amitriptyline. She wonders if the improvement is from the medication or from her reduced overnight shift schedule.

Side effects: Dry mouth persists mildly. No other side effects. Weight has been stable at 64 kg.

General health: No new concerns. Menstrual cycles regular on Alesse. No mood concerns (PHQ-2: 0/6). Sleep adequate — she continues to have some disrupted sleep around shift transitions but manages it well. No respiratory, GI, GU, or MSK complaints.

Social: Same employer, same role. Social life is good. In a stable relationship. No smoking, occasional social alcohol, no recreational drugs.

Family history update: Mother (age 52) recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Father healthy. One sibling, healthy.

She had her COVID-19 booster in September 2025 and flu vaccine in October 2025.

### Objective

- Vitals: BP 112/68 mmHg, HR 64 bpm, Temp 36.4 C, RR 14, SpO2 99% RA
- Weight: 64.0 kg, Height: 168 cm, BMI: 22.7
- General: Well-appearing, pleasant, no acute distress
- HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils equal and reactive. Fundi normal. TMs clear. Oropharynx normal. No lymphadenopathy.
- Neck: Supple, no thyromegaly. Minimal trapezius tension bilaterally (improved from prior).
- Cardiovascular: S1 S2 normal, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs
- Respiratory: Clear bilaterally
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly
- Breast exam: No masses, no axillary lymphadenopathy
- Neurological: Cranial nerves II-XII intact. Motor 5/5 throughout. Sensation intact. DTRs 2+ symmetric. Coordination and gait normal.
- Skin: No concerning lesions
- Mental health: PHQ-2 0/6 (negative)

Bloodwork ordered today: CBC, fasting glucose, HbA1c (given new family history of T2DM in mother), lipid panel, TSH.

### Assessment

1. **Migraine without aura, on amitriptyline prophylaxis** — Excellent response. Frequency reduced from 4-5/month to 1-2/month over 11 months of treatment. Well-tolerated. Patient inquires about potential discontinuation.
2. **Annual health examination** — No concerns identified. Updated family history (maternal T2DM) warrants metabolic screening. Immunizations up to date.
3. **Penicillin allergy** — Documented. No acute relevance.

### Plan

1. **Amitriptyline 25 mg qHS — continue.** Discussed discontinuation question with patient:
   - Guidelines suggest continuing migraine prophylaxis for at least 6-12 months after good control is established before considering a taper.
   - She has had good control since approximately January 2025, so ~9 months. Could consider a gradual taper in early 2026 if she remains stable.
   - Taper plan (for future): Reduce to 10 mg qHS for 2-4 weeks, then discontinue. Resume if migraines return to previous frequency.
   - Patient agrees to continue through winter (shift work stress tends to be higher in winter months) and revisit taper discussion at next visit.
2. Continue rizatriptan 10 mg PO PRN and naproxen 500 mg PO PRN.
3. Continue migraine diary — important to have baseline data for comparison if/when taper is attempted.
4. Bloodwork: CBC, fasting glucose, HbA1c, lipid panel, TSH. Follow up results by phone or MyChart message.
5. Continue Alesse OCP. Next Pap test due 2028.
6. Lifestyle: Continue current sleep hygiene practices. Discussed light exercise (she walks 3-4 times/week) as beneficial for both migraine prevention and metabolic health.
7. Flu vaccine: Completed. COVID booster: Completed.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: 6 months or sooner if migraine frequency changes; will discuss amitriptyline taper at next visit
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 6: 2026-01-22 — FP Visit: Acute Migraine / Amitriptyline Taper Discussion

- Date: 2026-01-22
- Time: 16:15
- Type: Walk-in
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Kitchener-Waterloo Family Health Team, 200 King St W, Suite 400, Kitchener, ON
- Practitioner: Dr. Robert Osei, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-65189)
- Reason for visit: Acute migraine; follow-up discussion re prophylaxis taper

### Subjective

Sofia presents as a same-day urgent appointment at her Family Health Team. She is currently experiencing a migraine that started approximately 5 hours ago (onset ~11:00). She took rizatriptan 10 mg at 11:15, which provided partial relief (reduced from 7/10 to 4/10 by noon), but the headache has rebounded to 6/10 over the past 2 hours. She took naproxen 500 mg at 14:00 with minimal additional benefit. Unilateral right-sided throbbing, photophobia, mild nausea, no vomiting. Typical migraine character.

Context: She ran out of amitriptyline approximately 10 days ago (around January 12). She had been meaning to call in for a refill but forgot during a busy stretch of shifts. She has therefore been off amitriptyline for 10 days unintentionally. She wonders if this contributed to the current migraine and notes she also had a migraine 5 days ago (January 17, which she managed at home with rizatriptan — resolved in 4 hours).

Migraine diary review (brief):
- November 2025: 1 migraine
- December 2025: 1 migraine
- January 2026 (to date): 2 migraines (January 17 and today)

She reports her sleep has been somewhat worse since stopping amitriptyline — it takes her longer to fall asleep, particularly after evening shifts. She does not feel the 10 days off amitriptyline caused any withdrawal symptoms (no rebound anxiety, no GI upset), but she does feel her headache threshold has lowered.

She also wants to discuss: given she unintentionally stopped, should she restart or use this as an opportunity to stay off and see how she does?

Bloodwork results from October 2025 (reviewed via MyChart): CBC normal. Fasting glucose 5.1 mmol/L (normal). HbA1c 5.2% (normal). Lipid panel: Total cholesterol 4.6, LDL 2.4, HDL 1.6, TG 1.0 — all normal. TSH 2.3 mIU/L (normal).

### Objective

- Vitals: BP 124/76 mmHg, HR 78 bpm, Temp 36.5 C
- Weight: 63.5 kg
- General: Mildly uncomfortable, squinting under exam room lights. Speaking quietly. Not in severe distress.
- HEENT: No sinus tenderness. Temporal arteries non-tender.
- Neck: Supple, no meningismus. Moderate bilateral trapezius tension.
- Neurological: Alert, oriented x3. Cranial nerves II-XII intact. No focal deficits.

### Assessment

1. **Acute migraine without aura** — Partially treated with rizatriptan and naproxen. Rebound after initial partial response. This is the second migraine in 5 days, coinciding with unintentional discontinuation of amitriptyline 10 days ago.
2. **Migraine prophylaxis — unintentional discontinuation of amitriptyline** — The temporal relationship between stopping amitriptyline and increased migraine frequency suggests the medication was providing meaningful prophylactic benefit. Two migraines in 10 days (after months of 1/month) supports this.
3. **October 2025 bloodwork** — All results normal. HbA1c normal despite new family history of maternal T2DM.

### Plan

1. **Acute migraine treatment:** Administered metoclopramide 10 mg PO and ketorolac 30 mg PO (patient prefers oral to IV today; she has not vomited and can tolerate PO). Patient to rest in quiet room for 30 minutes.
   - Reassessed at 30 minutes: Headache improved to 2/10. Nausea resolved. Patient feels significantly better.
2. **Amitriptyline taper discussion:**
   - Reviewed the situation: unintentional discontinuation (abrupt, not tapered) has been followed by increased migraine frequency. This suggests prophylaxis is still needed.
   - Options discussed:
     - (a) Restart amitriptyline 25 mg qHS and continue for another 6 months before a planned, gradual taper.
     - (b) Restart at 10 mg qHS (since she has been off for 10 days) and see if 10 mg is sufficient (effectively a partial taper).
   - Patient prefers option (b): restart at 10 mg qHS and observe for 2-3 months. If migraines remain well-controlled at 10 mg, could then attempt full discontinuation with a slow taper.
   - **Rx: Amitriptyline 10 mg PO qHS. Qty 90, 0 refills.** If migraine frequency returns to >3/month, increase back to 25 mg and contact office.
3. Continue rizatriptan 10 mg PO PRN (renewed Rx: qty 12, 1 refill).
4. Continue naproxen 500 mg PO PRN.
5. Continue migraine diary — particularly important over the next 2-3 months to assess whether 10 mg is sufficient.
6. Sleep: Discussed that the return of sleep onset difficulty off amitriptyline underscores the importance of non-pharmacologic sleep hygiene. Reviewed strategies again. If insomnia persists independent of migraines, can address separately.
7. Bloodwork results reviewed and reassuring. No metabolic concerns at this time. Will recheck HbA1c annually given family history.
8. Continue Alesse OCP.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: 2-3 months (target April 2026) to assess response to amitriptyline 10 mg dose reduction
- Referrals: None; neurology referral remains available if needed but has not been required given good overall response to prophylaxis
