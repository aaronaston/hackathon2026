### Subjective

Ethan Brown is a 19-year-old male university student presenting for his annual physical examination. He is currently in his first year at McMaster University studying kinesiology. He reports feeling well overall with no active complaints. He denies chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, cough, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, or changes in bowel habits. He has a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis, typically occurring in April through June, with symptoms of sneezing, nasal congestion, clear rhinorrhea, and itchy/watery eyes. He has managed this in the past with over-the-counter cetirizine 10 mg as needed, which he finds effective. He has not yet started taking it this spring as symptoms have been minimal so far. No history of asthma or eczema. No prior surgeries or hospitalizations. No known drug allergies. He exercises regularly — plays intramural basketball twice weekly and goes to the university gym 3-4 times per week. Diet is variable; he eats in the campus dining hall most days. Non-smoker, no vaping, no recreational drug use. Alcohol use is social, approximately 2-3 drinks on weekends. Sleeps 7-8 hours per night. Mental health is good; adjustment to university has gone well. Sexual health: sexually active with one female partner, uses condoms consistently; no concerns. Family history: mother has seasonal allergies and mild asthma; father has hypertension (diagnosed age 52); paternal grandfather had type 2 diabetes. No family history of cancer, cardiac disease in early age, or autoimmune conditions.

## Encounter 2: 2025-05-06 — Spring Allergy Flare / Sinusitis Concern

- Date: 2025-05-06
- Time: 14:15
- Type: Walk-in
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Halton Hills Family Health Team (233 Lakeshore Rd E, Suite 201, Oakville, ON)
- Practitioner: Dr. Catherine Brooks, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-64755)
- Reason for visit: Worsening nasal congestion, facial pressure, and headache x 5 days

### Subjective

Ethan presents on a walk-in basis with a 5-day history of worsening nasal congestion, bilateral facial pressure (maxillary area), frontal headache, and thick yellow-green nasal discharge. He reports his usual seasonal allergy symptoms began approximately three weeks ago with sneezing, clear rhinorrhea, and itchy eyes. He started taking cetirizine 10 mg daily at that time with moderate relief. Over the past 5 days, the character of his symptoms has changed: the nasal discharge became thick and discoloured, he developed facial pressure that worsens when bending forward, and he has a dull frontal headache rated 4/10. He has also noticed post-nasal drip with an intermittent productive cough, worse at night. He reports mild fatigue but no significant fever — he felt mildly warm two days ago but did not measure his temperature. No sore throat. No ear pain. No visual changes. No history of recurrent sinusitis. He tried adding a saline nasal rinse (NeilMed) two days ago with minimal improvement. He has been continuing cetirizine daily. He is in his second year at McMaster and has exams coming up, so he is keen to feel better. No new medications. No drug allergies.

### Objective

- Vitals: BP 116/70 mmHg, HR 74 bpm, Temp 37.2 C, RR 14, SpO2 99% RA
- General: Mildly congested-sounding voice, no acute distress
- HEENT:
  - Nasal mucosa: erythematous and edematous bilaterally, inferior turbinates swollen; thick yellow-green mucoid discharge visible in both nares
  - Facial tenderness: bilateral maxillary tenderness to percussion and palpation; mild frontal tenderness
  - No periorbital edema, erythema, or swelling
  - Oropharynx: mild posterior pharyngeal cobblestoning consistent with post-nasal drip; no tonsillar exudates or enlargement
  - Ears: TMs normal bilaterally, no effusion
  - Eyes: mild bilateral conjunctival injection with watery discharge; no chemosis
- Neck: No cervical lymphadenopathy
- Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes

### Assessment

1. **Acute rhinosinusitis, likely viral, superimposed on seasonal allergic rhinitis** — 5-day duration of purulent nasal discharge and facial pressure. Per Canadian clinical practice guidelines, bacterial sinusitis is diagnosed clinically when symptoms persist beyond 7-10 days without improvement, or with biphasic worsening ("double sickening"). At day 5, this is more likely viral rhinosinusitis or allergic rhinitis with secondary mucosal inflammation. Antibiotics are not indicated at this time.
2. **Seasonal allergic rhinitis** — undertreated this season. Cetirizine alone is providing insufficient symptom control, which likely predisposed to mucosal edema and impaired sinus drainage.
3. **Allergic conjunctivitis** — mild, bilateral, consistent with seasonal allergy.

### Plan

1. **No antibiotics at this time** — clinical picture is consistent with acute viral rhinosinusitis at day 5. Discussed with patient the criteria for antibiotic use (symptoms >10 days without improvement, or biphasic worsening with fever).
2. **Intranasal corticosteroid** — start fluticasone propionate nasal spray 50 mcg/spray, 2 sprays per nostril once daily. This will address both the underlying allergic rhinitis and reduce sinus mucosal inflammation. Instructed on proper spray technique (aim away from septum, sniff gently).
3. Continue cetirizine 10 mg PO once daily through allergy season (April-June).
4. Continue saline nasal irrigation (NeilMed sinus rinse) twice daily — helps with mucociliary clearance and symptom relief.
5. Acetaminophen 500 mg PO q4-6h PRN (max 4 g/day) or ibuprofen 400 mg PO q6h PRN with food for facial pain and headache.
6. Adequate hydration, rest as able given exam schedule.
7. For allergic conjunctivitis: over-the-counter ketotifen ophthalmic drops (Zaditor) 1 drop to each eye twice daily PRN.
8. **Return precautions:** return or call if symptoms persist beyond 10 days total, worsen significantly, high fever (>38.5 C), periorbital swelling or erythema, severe unilateral facial pain, or visual changes. If symptoms worsen after initial improvement ("double sickening"), reassess for bacterial sinusitis and possible antibiotic therapy.
9. If this seasonal allergy pattern continues to cause significant symptoms annually, may consider starting intranasal corticosteroid prophylactically 1-2 weeks before typical symptom onset each spring.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: Return in 7-10 days if symptoms not improving, or sooner if worsening; otherwise as needed
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 3: 2025-11-18 — Annual Physical Examination

- Date: 2025-11-18
- Time: 10:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Halton Hills Family Health Team (233 Lakeshore Rd E, Suite 201, Oakville, ON)
- Practitioner: Dr. Catherine Brooks, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-64755)
- Reason for visit: Annual health examination

### Subjective

Ethan presents for his annual physical. He is now 21 years old, in his third year at McMaster University studying kinesiology. He reports feeling well overall. Regarding the acute rhinosinusitis episode in May, he states that his symptoms improved significantly within 3-4 days of starting the fluticasone nasal spray and saline rinses. He did not require antibiotics and recovered fully. He continued the fluticasone spray daily through the end of June and then stopped it when allergy season ended. He found the combination of cetirizine and fluticasone much more effective than cetirizine alone and plans to start both earlier next spring. No recurrence of sinus symptoms. No other illnesses, ER visits, or walk-in visits since May. He has been exercising regularly — plays intramural basketball, goes to the gym 3-4 times per week, and has taken up recreational running. Diet has improved; he is doing more of his own cooking in his off-campus apartment this year. Non-smoker, no vaping, no recreational drug use. Alcohol use remains social, approximately 2-4 drinks on weekends. Sleep is 7 hours per night on average; admits to later bedtimes due to study schedule. Mental health is good; enjoys his program and has a solid social network. Sexual health: currently in a relationship, uses condoms; no concerns. No new medications or supplements other than occasional cetirizine. No drug allergies. Family history unchanged.

### Assessment

1. **Healthy 21-year-old male** — no active medical concerns. Physical examination and bloodwork entirely normal. Lipid panel within desirable range.
2. **Seasonal allergic rhinitis** — well controlled this past season with combination therapy (cetirizine + fluticasone nasal spray). Acute rhinosinusitis episode in May 2025 resolved without antibiotics. Patient has a good management plan for next spring.
3. **Routine health maintenance** — up to date. No additional immunizations required. Influenza vaccine discussed — patient declines this year but will consider in future.

### Plan

1. **Seasonal allergy management plan for spring 2026:**
   - Start fluticasone propionate nasal spray 50 mcg/spray, 2 sprays per nostril once daily, beginning 1-2 weeks before typical symptom onset (mid-March to early April).
   - Continue cetirizine 10 mg PO daily PRN through allergy season (April-June).
   - Saline nasal rinse as needed for symptom flares.
   - Ketotifen ophthalmic drops PRN for allergic conjunctivitis if it recurs.
2. Encouraged to continue current exercise routine and improved dietary habits.
3. Discussed sleep hygiene: encouraged aiming for 7-8 hours; reviewed impact of screen time and late-night studying on sleep quality.
4. Reviewed low-risk alcohol use guidelines; current consumption within acceptable range but encouraged moderation during social events.
5. No bloodwork abnormalities; lipid panel baseline established and is normal.
6. Discussed that given family history of paternal hypertension and paternal grandfather's diabetes, ongoing healthy lifestyle habits are particularly beneficial for long-term risk reduction.
7. Return for annual physical in approximately 1 year, or sooner if any concerns arise.
