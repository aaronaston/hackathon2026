## Encounter 1: 2024-03-19 — GERD Follow-up / Post-Endoscopy Results Review

- Date: 2024-03-19
- Time: 10:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton)
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: GERD follow-up and review of upper endoscopy results

### Subjective
Mr. Tremblay presents for review of his recent upper endoscopy results and ongoing gastroesophageal reflux disease management. He was referred to gastroenterology in late 2023 for persistent heartburn and epigastric discomfort despite an initial trial of over-the-counter antacids and H2 receptor antagonists. He underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with Dr. Michael Stern at St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton on 2024-02-22.

He reports that his symptoms have been somewhat improved since starting Pantoprazole 40 mg daily approximately six weeks ago (started after the endoscopy). He still experiences occasional heartburn, particularly in the late evening after finishing work. He describes the heartburn as a burning substernal sensation, usually 1-2 times per week, compared to near-daily episodes prior to starting the PPI. He denies dysphagia, odynophagia, hematemesis, melena, unintentional weight loss, or vomiting. He notes that his symptoms tend to worsen on evenings when he eats later (typically after 22:00 due to his work schedule as a chef). He frequently tastes meals throughout his shifts, which he suspects also contributes.

Past medical history: GERD (diagnosed late 2023, endoscopy 2024-02-22). No surgical history. No other medical conditions.

Current medications: Pantoprazole 40 mg PO daily (started approximately February 2024).

Allergies: No known drug allergies.

Social history: Non-smoker. Alcohol: 2-3 beers per week, primarily on days off. Occupation: chef at a restaurant in London, ON. Moved to London from Hamilton approximately two years ago for the position; remains rostered with the Hamilton Mountain FHT where he has been a patient since his early twenties. Lives at 62 Albert St, London, ON, with his partner. No recreational drug use.

Family history: Father with hypertension. Mother well. No family history of gastrointestinal malignancy or inflammatory bowel disease.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 124/78 mmHg, HR 72 bpm, RR 14, Temp 36.5 C, SpO2 99% RA
- Height: 178 cm, Weight: 82.1 kg, BMI: 25.9 kg/m2
- General: Well-appearing male, no acute distress
- HEENT: Oropharynx clear, no dental erosions noted
- Cardiovascular: S1 S2 normal, no murmurs
- Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended. No epigastric tenderness today. No organomegaly. Bowel sounds normal

EGD report (Dr. Michael Stern, MD FRCPC, Gastroenterology, St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton, 2024-02-22):
- Esophagus: Mild erythema and non-confluent mucosal breaks in the distal esophagus, consistent with Los Angeles Grade A esophagitis. No Barrett's mucosa identified. No stricture.
- Gastroesophageal junction: Regular Z-line at 39 cm from the incisors. No hiatal hernia.
- Stomach: Normal gastric mucosa. Gastric biopsies obtained.
- Duodenum: Normal duodenal mucosa.
- Biopsies: Gastric antral and corpus biopsies — mild chronic inactive gastritis. Helicobacter pylori: negative (histology and rapid urease test). No intestinal metaplasia. No dysplasia.
- Impression: Los Angeles Grade A reflux esophagitis. H. pylori negative. Recommend PPI therapy and lifestyle modifications.

### Assessment
1. Gastroesophageal reflux disease — confirmed by EGD showing LA Grade A esophagitis. H. pylori negative. Symptoms partially improved on Pantoprazole 40 mg daily (from daily to 1-2 times per week). Residual symptoms likely related to late-evening eating and occupational factors (frequent food tasting as a chef).
2. Lifestyle factors — occupational challenges to GERD management are significant. Late meals, irregular eating schedule, and constant exposure to food/spice as a chef make adherence to standard GERD lifestyle modifications difficult.

### Plan
1. Continue Pantoprazole 40 mg PO daily, taken 30-60 minutes before breakfast. Emphasized importance of consistent timing for optimal acid suppression.
2. Lifestyle modification counselling:
   - Avoid eating within 3 hours of lying down. Discussed the challenge given his work schedule (shifts often end at 22:00-23:00). Suggested a lighter snack rather than a full meal after late shifts if possible.
   - Elevate the head of the bed 15-20 cm using bed risers or a wedge pillow if nighttime symptoms persist.
   - Minimize known triggers: spicy foods, acidic foods, caffeine, alcohol, fatty foods. Acknowledged this is particularly challenging given his occupation. Encouraged him to spit rather than swallow when tasting dishes at work where feasible.
   - Avoid tight-fitting clothing around the abdomen during shifts.
3. Current weight is within normal range (BMI 25.9); no weight loss indicated, but advised to avoid weight gain as this may exacerbate reflux.
4. Plan for 8-week course of Pantoprazole 40 mg daily (total), then reassess symptoms. If well controlled, will discuss step-down to 20 mg daily or on-demand dosing at follow-up.
5. No need for H. pylori eradication (negative on both histology and rapid urease test).
6. No immediate need for repeat endoscopy. LA Grade A esophagitis does not require routine surveillance if symptoms respond to PPI therapy.
7. Follow-up in approximately 5 months to reassess symptoms and discuss PPI step-down.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 5 months (approximately August 2024) for GERD reassessment and PPI step-down discussion
- Referrals: None — GI consultation complete; shared care with family physician going forward

## Encounter 2: 2024-08-13 — PPI Step-Down Trial Discussion

- Date: 2024-08-13
- Time: 14:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton)
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: GERD management — PPI step-down trial reassessment

### Subjective
Mr. Tremblay returns for his planned reassessment after approximately five months on Pantoprazole 40 mg daily. He reports significant improvement in his GERD symptoms. Heartburn episodes have decreased to approximately once every 1-2 weeks, typically on days when he eats later than usual after evening shifts. He has implemented some of the recommended lifestyle changes: he purchased a wedge pillow and uses it nightly, he avoids eating full meals after 22:00 on most evenings (opting for lighter snacks instead), and he has reduced his coffee intake from 3-4 cups to 1-2 cups per day. He acknowledges that tasting food throughout his shifts remains a constant occupational necessity and that he cannot fully avoid acidic or spicy ingredients.

He denies dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, hematemesis, melena, nausea, or vomiting. No chest pain or respiratory symptoms. He reports no side effects from Pantoprazole that he has noticed. He is interested in whether he can reduce his PPI dose as they previously discussed.

No new medications. No allergies. No other health concerns today.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 120/76 mmHg, HR 70 bpm
- Weight: 81.4 kg, BMI: 25.7 kg/m2
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended. No epigastric tenderness. Bowel sounds normal.

### Assessment
1. Gastroesophageal reflux disease — well controlled on Pantoprazole 40 mg daily. Symptoms reduced from near-daily to approximately twice monthly. Patient has made meaningful lifestyle modifications despite occupational constraints. LA Grade A esophagitis on endoscopy (February 2024) is expected to have healed with this duration of PPI therapy.
2. PPI step-down — appropriate to trial. Current guidelines support step-down to the lowest effective PPI dose for long-term GERD management to minimize unnecessary exposure. Long-term PPI use at full dose carries small but non-negligible risks including hypomagnesemia, C. difficile infection, reduced calcium absorption, and potential vitamin B12 malabsorption.

### Plan
1. Step down Pantoprazole from 40 mg to 20 mg PO daily, taken 30-60 minutes before breakfast. Begin immediately.
2. If symptoms recur significantly on the lower dose, patient may temporarily return to 40 mg daily and contact the clinic to discuss.
3. Discussed on-demand PPI use as a future goal: if symptoms remain controlled on 20 mg daily for 3-4 months, may trial intermittent or on-demand dosing (taking Pantoprazole only when symptomatic or in anticipation of known triggers).
4. Continue lifestyle modifications — reinforced importance of the wedge pillow, avoiding late meals, and dietary trigger avoidance where feasible.
5. Advised that mild rebound acid hypersecretion may occur transiently when stepping down the dose. Reassured that this typically resolves within 1-2 weeks and does not indicate worsening disease.
6. No repeat endoscopy indicated at this time.
7. Discussed long-term monitoring considerations: if patient remains on PPI for > 1 year, will monitor magnesium level annually and consider calcium/vitamin D supplementation counselling.
8. Follow-up in 4-5 months, or sooner if symptoms worsen on the reduced dose.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 4-5 months (approximately December 2024 - January 2025) or sooner if symptoms recur
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 3: 2024-12-11 — Acute Epigastric Pain Episode

- Date: 2024-12-11
- Time: 18:45
- Type: Walk-in
- Setting: Walk-in Clinic
- Organization: Hamilton Medical Walk-in Centre
- Practitioner: Dr. Lisa Fernandes, MD (ON-PRAC-71083)
- Reason for visit: Acute epigastric pain and worsening heartburn x 3 days

### Subjective
Mr. Tremblay presents to the walk-in clinic with a 3-day history of worsening epigastric pain and heartburn. He describes the pain as a burning sensation in the epigastric region, radiating substernally, rated 6/10 in intensity. The pain is worse after eating and when lying down. He reports associated acid regurgitation and a sour taste in the back of his throat, particularly at night. He has not been sleeping well due to nocturnal symptoms over the past two nights.

He has a known history of GERD with LA Grade A esophagitis on endoscopy in February 2024. He was previously well controlled on Pantoprazole 40 mg daily and was stepped down to 20 mg daily in August 2024 by his family physician, Dr. Hannah Moreau. He reports that for the past 3-4 weeks, he has been experiencing more frequent heartburn (3-4 times per week), which he initially attributed to the busy holiday season at work. He works as a chef and explains that the restaurant's holiday menu has required him to work longer hours (12-14 hour shifts), eat later, and taste richer, more acidic dishes more frequently. He also admits he has been less consistent with his wedge pillow and has been drinking more coffee (4-5 cups per day) to manage fatigue.

He denies dysphagia, odynophagia, hematemesis, melena, vomiting, fever, chills, or unintentional weight loss. No radiation of pain to the jaw, arm, or back. No shortness of breath or diaphoresis. No changes in bowel habits.

He was unable to get a same-day appointment with his family physician in Hamilton and is visiting family in the Hamilton area today, so he came to the walk-in clinic.

Current medications: Pantoprazole 20 mg PO daily. No allergies.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 130/82 mmHg, HR 78 bpm, RR 16, Temp 36.6 C, SpO2 98% RA
- General: Mildly uncomfortable, no acute distress
- Cardiovascular: S1 S2 normal, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs
- Respiratory: Clear bilaterally
- Abdomen: Soft, moderate tenderness in the epigastrium on palpation. No rebound tenderness or guarding. No Murphy's sign. No distension. Bowel sounds present and normal.
- No peritoneal signs

ECG: Normal sinus rhythm, rate 76 bpm, normal axis, no ST-T wave changes, no Q waves. No acute ischemic changes.

### Assessment
1. GERD flare — most likely diagnosis given known history of reflux esophagitis, characteristic symptoms (burning epigastric pain, acid regurgitation, nocturnal symptoms), and clear precipitating factors (PPI dose reduction, increased occupational stress and dietary triggers, reduced adherence to lifestyle modifications). No alarm features (no dysphagia, weight loss, hematemesis, or melena).
2. Acute coronary syndrome — excluded clinically. Pain is characteristic of reflux (burning, postprandial, positional). No cardiac risk factors in a 32-year-old male. ECG normal. Pre-test probability very low.
3. Peptic ulcer disease — less likely given recent negative endoscopy (February 2024) with no ulceration and negative H. pylori. However, if symptoms persist despite appropriate therapy, repeat endoscopy should be considered.

### Plan
1. Increase Pantoprazole back to 40 mg PO daily, taken 30-60 minutes before breakfast. Step-down trial at 20 mg was unsuccessful in the context of current dietary and lifestyle stressors.
2. Add Gaviscon (sodium alginate) 10 mL PO after meals and at bedtime as needed for breakthrough symptoms. Available over the counter.
3. Urgent lifestyle modification reinforcement:
   - Resume wedge pillow use every night without exception.
   - Minimize eating within 3 hours of lying down. If late-shift eating is unavoidable, keep the meal small and avoid known triggers (tomato-based sauces, citrus, chocolate, peppermint, high-fat foods).
   - Reduce coffee intake back to 1-2 cups per day.
   - Avoid alcohol during the flare period.
4. If symptoms do not improve within 7-10 days on Pantoprazole 40 mg, or if alarm symptoms develop (dysphagia, weight loss, vomiting, GI bleeding), advised to seek urgent medical attention.
5. Clinic note to be forwarded to Dr. Hannah Moreau at Hamilton Mountain FHT for continuity of care.
6. Encouraged follow-up with family physician in 4-6 weeks to reassess once the acute flare has settled and the holiday work schedule has normalized.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: With family physician (Dr. Hannah Moreau) in 4-6 weeks for reassessment
- Referrals: None (clinic note forwarded to Hamilton Mountain FHT)

## Encounter 4: 2025-04-08 — GERD Management and Lifestyle Counselling

- Date: 2025-04-08
- Time: 11:15
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton)
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: GERD management follow-up and lifestyle counselling

### Subjective
Mr. Tremblay presents for GERD follow-up. He notes that the walk-in visit in December 2024 prompted him to take his reflux management more seriously. He was stepped back up to Pantoprazole 40 mg daily at that visit and reports that his symptoms improved significantly within about 10 days. He continued Gaviscon after meals for approximately 3 weeks during the acute flare, then discontinued it as symptoms settled. He is currently experiencing heartburn approximately once per week, usually mild, and almost always on days when he eats late after evening shifts.

He has made additional lifestyle changes since the December flare:
- He now consistently uses his wedge pillow every night.
- He has negotiated with his employer to have a colleague handle final tasting duties on nights when he is scheduled to close, reducing his food intake after 21:00.
- He has reduced coffee to 1-2 cups in the morning only.
- He has reduced alcohol intake to 1-2 beers per week, mostly on weekends.
- He has been more mindful about eating speed and portion sizes during his shifts.

He denies dysphagia, odynophagia, hematemesis, melena, nausea, vomiting, or weight changes. No chest pain or respiratory symptoms. He reports sleeping better since resuming the wedge pillow. He does express some concern about being on a PPI long-term and asks whether there are risks he should be aware of.

No new medications. No allergies.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 122/76 mmHg, HR 68 bpm, RR 14, Temp 36.5 C, SpO2 99% RA
- Weight: 82.5 kg, BMI: 26.0 kg/m2
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended. No epigastric tenderness. No organomegaly. Bowel sounds normal.

Lab results (drawn 2025-04-01, ordered to establish baseline for long-term PPI monitoring):
- Magnesium: 0.85 mmol/L (normal 0.70-1.05)
- Calcium: 2.38 mmol/L (normal 2.15-2.55)
- Vitamin B12: 380 pmol/L (normal > 150)
- CBC: within normal limits
- Creatinine: 88 umol/L, eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73m2

### Assessment
1. Gastroesophageal reflux disease — improved and well controlled on Pantoprazole 40 mg daily with lifestyle modifications. Symptoms reduced to approximately weekly, mild episodes linked to identifiable triggers. Patient has made commendable occupational adaptations. Prior step-down attempt to 20 mg was unsuccessful in the context of significant occupational and dietary stress (December 2024 flare). Given the failed step-down, will maintain current dose for the next several months before reconsidering.
2. Long-term PPI use — patient has been on Pantoprazole for approximately 14 months. Discussed the evidence regarding long-term PPI risks:
   - Hypomagnesemia: baseline magnesium normal. Will monitor annually.
   - Calcium absorption and fracture risk: very low absolute risk increase. Advised adequate calcium and vitamin D intake through diet.
   - Vitamin B12 deficiency: baseline B12 normal. Will monitor periodically.
   - C. difficile: small increased risk. Advised on food safety (relevant given his occupation).
   - Kidney disease: creatinine and eGFR normal.
   - Reassured that for patients with documented esophagitis and ongoing symptoms, the benefits of PPI therapy outweigh the small risks.
3. Weight — stable (BMI 26.0). No significant change from baseline.

### Plan
1. Continue Pantoprazole 40 mg PO daily. No dose change at this time given recent flare history and occupational challenges. Will reconsider step-down after a sustained period of stability (target: reassess at next visit).
2. Continue lifestyle modifications — patient is doing well with current adaptations. Encouraged him to maintain the changes even during busier periods at work.
3. Discussed the option of adding a prokinetic agent (e.g., domperidone) if nocturnal symptoms worsen, but not indicated at present.
4. Annual monitoring for long-term PPI use: magnesium, vitamin B12, creatinine — baseline labs all normal today. Repeat in 12 months.
5. Calcium and vitamin D counselling: encouraged dietary calcium intake of 1000 mg/day through dairy, leafy greens, and fortified foods. Vitamin D supplementation of 1000 IU daily recommended given Canadian latitude and indoor occupation (long kitchen shifts).
6. No indication for repeat endoscopy at this time. Symptoms are well controlled and there are no alarm features. Will reconsider if symptoms change in character or if alarm features develop.
7. Schedule annual physical for September 2025.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: September 2025 for annual physical
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 5: 2025-09-16 — Annual Physical Examination

- Date: 2025-09-16
- Time: 09:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton)
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Annual health examination

### Subjective
Mr. Tremblay presents for his annual physical. He reports feeling well overall. His GERD remains stable on Pantoprazole 40 mg daily. Heartburn episodes occur approximately 2-3 times per month, generally mild and brief, and he has not needed to use Gaviscon in several months. He continues to use the wedge pillow nightly and has maintained his dietary and occupational adaptations.

He mentions that the restaurant has been quieter over the summer, which has allowed him to maintain a more regular eating schedule and finish shifts earlier. He has been cooking at home more on his days off and reports eating a generally balanced diet, though he acknowledges a weakness for rich foods given his profession.

He has no specific health concerns today. He has never had a significant illness requiring hospitalization. He denies headaches, visual changes, chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, cough, changes in bowel or bladder habits, musculoskeletal complaints, or skin concerns. He reports adequate sleep (7-8 hours on most nights when not working late shifts). Mood and energy are good. No mental health concerns.

Current medications: Pantoprazole 40 mg PO daily. Vitamin D 1000 IU daily (started April 2025 as recommended). No other medications or supplements. No allergies.

Social history unchanged: Non-smoker. Alcohol 1-2 beers per week. Chef. Lives with partner in London, ON. Sexually active, monogamous relationship. No recreational drug use.

Family history unchanged: Father with hypertension. Mother well.

### Objective

- Height: 178 cm, Weight: 83.0 kg, BMI: 26.2 kg/m2
- General: Well-appearing, fit-appearing male, no acute distress
- HEENT: Pupils equal and reactive, oropharynx clear, tympanic membranes normal bilaterally, no cervical lymphadenopathy, thyroid normal to palpation
- Cardiovascular: S1 S2 normal, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, peripheral pulses 2+ bilaterally
- Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, no organomegaly, no inguinal hernias
- Musculoskeletal: Normal gait, no joint swelling or tenderness
- Skin: No suspicious lesions. No rashes.
- Genitourinary: Deferred (patient declines today; no urologic complaints)
- Mental health screening: PHQ-2 score 0/6 (negative screen)

Lab results (drawn 2025-09-09):
- CBC: within normal limits
- Fasting glucose: 5.1 mmol/L (normal)
- HbA1c: 5.2% (normal, < 6.0%)
- Creatinine: 86 umol/L, eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73m2
- Total cholesterol: 4.4 mmol/L, LDL 2.5 mmol/L, HDL 1.3 mmol/L, TG 1.3 mmol/L
- ALT: 24 U/L (normal)
- TSH: 1.8 mIU/L (normal)
- Magnesium: 0.82 mmol/L (normal; annual monitoring for long-term PPI use)
- Vitamin B12: 395 pmol/L (normal)

### Assessment
1. Gastroesophageal reflux disease — stable and well controlled on Pantoprazole 40 mg daily with lifestyle modifications. Symptoms minimal (2-3 episodes per month, mild). No alarm features. Magnesium and B12 normal on annual PPI monitoring. Given the history of failed step-down in late 2024 and the patient's occupational risk factors, continuing Pantoprazole 40 mg daily is reasonable. May reconsider a cautious step-down attempt when the patient has a sustained quiet period occupationally (e.g., if his schedule changes or he has an extended break from work).
2. Health maintenance — 32-year-old male in good general health. No chronic diseases other than GERD. Normal metabolic panel, lipid panel, thyroid function, and CBC. BMI 26.2, mildly overweight but stable. Cardiovascular risk profile is low.
3. Mental health — PHQ-2 negative. No concerns.
4. Immunizations — Influenza vaccine administered today. COVID-19 booster: last dose was spring 2024; discussed updated fall 2025 booster; patient to schedule at pharmacy. Tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis: last Tdap at age 22; not yet due for Td booster (due at age 42).

### Plan
1. Continue Pantoprazole 40 mg PO daily.
2. Continue Vitamin D 1000 IU PO daily.
3. Influenza vaccine administered today (left deltoid, lot number documented in provincial immunization registry).
4. COVID-19 updated fall 2025 booster — advised to schedule at pharmacy at convenience.
5. Weight management counselling: BMI 26.2. Advised on maintaining current weight and avoiding gradual gain. Discussed that even modest weight gain can exacerbate GERD. Encouraged continued physical activity — patient reports walking and occasional cycling on days off.
6. Lipid panel: LDL 2.5 mmol/L, within acceptable range for a low-risk individual. No indication for statin therapy. Repeat in 3-5 years or if risk profile changes.
7. Fasting glucose and HbA1c normal — no evidence of prediabetes or diabetes. Repeat screening per guidelines.
8. Continue annual magnesium and B12 monitoring given ongoing PPI use.
9. Discussed PPI step-down: agreed to consider a trial of Pantoprazole 20 mg daily in spring 2026 when the restaurant schedule typically slows down post-winter season. Patient agrees to this plan.
10. Next routine follow-up at time of GERD reassessment / medication renewal (approximately February 2026).

### Disposition
- Follow-up: February 2026 for GERD reassessment and medication renewal
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 6: 2026-02-10 — GERD Stable / Medication Renewal

- Date: 2026-02-10
- Time: 13:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton)
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: GERD reassessment and Pantoprazole prescription renewal

### Subjective
Mr. Tremblay returns for his planned GERD follow-up and medication renewal. He reports that his reflux symptoms have remained stable and well controlled over the past five months. He estimates heartburn episodes 2-3 times per month, generally mild and short-lived, always in the context of late eating or dietary indiscretion. He has not required Gaviscon or any additional symptomatic relief. He continues to use the wedge pillow nightly and has maintained his dietary and occupational adaptations.

He recalls the plan from September 2025 to consider a step-down to Pantoprazole 20 mg daily during a quieter period at work. He reports that January and February are the slowest months at his restaurant. His shifts are currently 8-9 hours rather than the 12-14 hours typical of the holiday season. He is finishing work by 20:00-21:00 most evenings and eating dinner at a reasonable hour. He feels this would be a good time to attempt the step-down again.

He has been taking Vitamin D 1000 IU daily as recommended. He has been walking 20-30 minutes on most days off and reports feeling well physically and mentally. He received his COVID-19 booster in October 2025 at a pharmacy.

No new symptoms. No dysphagia, odynophagia, hematemesis, melena, nausea, vomiting, or weight changes. No chest pain, respiratory symptoms, or other concerns.

Current medications: Pantoprazole 40 mg PO daily, Vitamin D 1000 IU PO daily. No allergies.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 120/76 mmHg, HR 70 bpm, RR 14, Temp 36.6 C, SpO2 99% RA
- Weight: 82.8 kg, BMI: 26.1 kg/m2
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended. No epigastric tenderness. Bowel sounds normal.

Lab results (drawn 2026-02-03, annual PPI monitoring):
- Magnesium: 0.83 mmol/L (normal)
- Vitamin B12: 372 pmol/L (normal)
- Creatinine: 87 umol/L, eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73m2

### Assessment
1. Gastroesophageal reflux disease — stable, well controlled on Pantoprazole 40 mg daily for approximately 2 years. Symptoms are minimal (2-3 mild episodes per month). No alarm features. Patient has been on continuous PPI therapy since February 2024. Annual monitoring labs (magnesium, B12, creatinine) all remain normal.
2. PPI step-down — conditions are now favourable for a second attempt at dose reduction. The patient's current occupational schedule is more conducive to GERD management (shorter shifts, earlier mealtimes). The prior step-down attempt (August-December 2024) was complicated by a seasonal increase in occupational stress and dietary triggers. With ongoing lifestyle modifications and a quieter work period, a second trial is reasonable.
3. Weight — stable at 82.8 kg (BMI 26.1). No significant change.
4. General health — unremarkable. No new medical issues.

### Plan
1. Step down Pantoprazole from 40 mg to 20 mg PO daily, taken 30-60 minutes before breakfast. Begin immediately.
2. Prescription: Pantoprazole 20 mg PO daily, quantity 90, 1 refill (6-month supply). Also provided a backup prescription for Pantoprazole 40 mg PO daily x 30 days in case of significant symptom recurrence, to be filled only if needed.
3. On-demand Gaviscon (sodium alginate) 10 mL PO after meals or at bedtime as needed for breakthrough symptoms. Over the counter.
4. Counselled on expected mild rebound symptoms for 1-2 weeks after step-down. Reassured that this is transient and does not indicate disease worsening.
5. Continue all lifestyle modifications. Emphasized that the step-down is more likely to succeed if lifestyle changes are maintained consistently, particularly during future busy periods at work.
6. If symptoms return to the severity experienced in December 2024 (daily heartburn, sleep disruption, significant epigastric pain), return to 40 mg daily and contact the clinic. Do not tolerate escalating symptoms for more than 2 weeks.
7. Continue Vitamin D 1000 IU PO daily.
8. Follow-up in 3-4 months (May-June 2026) to reassess the step-down trial.
9. If the step-down is successful at that visit, will discuss transition to on-demand PPI use as a long-term goal.
10. Continue annual monitoring of magnesium, B12, and renal function for as long as PPI therapy continues.
11. Annual physical due approximately September 2026.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 3-4 months (May-June 2026) for PPI step-down reassessment
- Referrals: None
