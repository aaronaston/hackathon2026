## Encounter 2: 2024-08-15 — DEXA Scan Follow-Up / Osteoporosis Management

- Date: 2024-08-15
- Time: 14:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton, ON)
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Review DEXA scan results and osteoporosis management

### Subjective

Mrs. Rahimi presents to review her DEXA scan results completed on 2024-07-22 at Niagara Specialist Centre. She reports no interval complaints. No falls, no fractures, no new bone pain. She continues her medications as prescribed — levothyroxine first thing in the morning, alendronate on Sunday mornings 30 minutes prior to levothyroxine, and calcium/vitamin D as directed. She has been consistent with daily walking and has added a community tai chi class once per week for balance.

She asks about how long she will need to stay on alendronate and whether there are any long-term risks. She has read online about osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femur fractures and is concerned.

### Objective

Vitals:
- BP: 120/74 mmHg
- HR: 70 bpm, regular
- Weight: 59.3 kg
- Height: 157 cm

General: Well-appearing, no distress.

DEXA scan results (2024-07-22, Niagara Specialist Centre):
- Lumbar spine (L1-L4) T-score: -2.6 (previous June 2022: -2.7)
- Femoral neck T-score: -2.3 (previous June 2022: -2.4)
- Total hip T-score: -1.9 (previous June 2022: -2.0)
- Interpretation: Stable low bone density consistent with osteoporosis at lumbar spine and femoral neck. Marginal improvement or stable at all sites compared to 2022.

FRAX 10-year fracture risk (calculated with BMD):
- Major osteoporotic fracture: 18%
- Hip fracture: 4.2%

### Assessment

1. **Osteoporosis** — DEXA results show stable bone density with possible marginal improvement at all measured sites compared to 2022. This is a favourable response to bisphosphonate therapy. T-scores remain in the osteoporotic range at lumbar spine and femoral neck. FRAX 10-year major osteoporotic fracture risk of 18% supports continued treatment. Patient has been on alendronate since 2021 (approximately 3 years); guidelines suggest reassessment of bisphosphonate need at 5 years for oral therapy. No indication for drug holiday at this time given ongoing high fracture risk.
2. **Hypothyroidism** — Stable, no symptoms. TSH was normal in April.

### Plan

1. Continue alendronate 70 mg PO weekly. Discussed long-term bisphosphonate risks: osteonecrosis of the jaw is very rare (approximately 1 in 10,000-100,000 patient-years for oral bisphosphonates) and primarily associated with IV bisphosphonates in oncology settings. Atypical femur fractures are also very rare and more associated with prolonged use beyond 5 years. Reassured patient that benefits outweigh risks at this time. Will reassess at the 5-year mark (2026).
2. Continue calcium carbonate 500 mg BID and vitamin D3 1000 IU daily.
3. Continue levothyroxine 88 mcg daily — no change.
4. Reinforced importance of fall prevention: continue tai chi, ensure adequate home lighting, remove trip hazards. Discussed hip protectors — patient declines at this time.
5. Advised to maintain regular dental care and inform dentist of bisphosphonate use before any invasive dental procedures.
6. Repeat DEXA in 2 years (summer 2026).

### Disposition

- Follow-up: In 4 months for TSH check and routine medication renewal.
- Referrals: None.

- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton, ON)
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Routine TSH monitoring and medication renewal

### Subjective

Mrs. Rahimi presents for her scheduled TSH check and medication renewal. She reports feeling well overall. No fatigue, no cold or heat intolerance, no weight changes, no hair loss, no constipation. She continues to take levothyroxine 88 mcg on an empty stomach each morning, separated appropriately from her weekly alendronate dose.

She mentions she has been experiencing occasional mild heartburn after taking her alendronate, lasting about 15-20 minutes. This has happened approximately 3 times over the past 2 months. She confirms she takes the alendronate with a full glass of water and remains upright for at least 30 minutes afterward. She denies dysphagia, odynophagia, or persistent GI symptoms.

No falls. No fractures. Continuing tai chi and daily walks despite the cold weather — she walks at the Pen Centre mall when it is icy outside.

### Objective

Vitals:
- BP: 126/78 mmHg
- HR: 68 bpm, regular
- Weight: 60.1 kg

General: Well-appearing, no distress.
Thyroid: Non-enlarged, no nodules. No tenderness.
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender. No epigastric tenderness on palpation.

Lab results (drawn 2024-11-28):
- TSH: 3.1 mIU/L (ref 0.4-4.0)
- Free T4: 15.8 pmol/L (ref 12-22)

### Assessment

1. **Hypothyroidism** — Well controlled. TSH 3.1 and free T4 15.8, both within normal limits. No clinical symptoms. No dose adjustment required.
2. **Osteoporosis** — Stable on current regimen. Occasional mild heartburn with alendronate use is noted; not severe or persistent. Does not meet criteria for switching therapy at this time.
3. **Alendronate-related upper GI symptoms** — Mild and infrequent. Proper administration technique confirmed. Will monitor.

### Plan

1. Continue levothyroxine 88 mcg PO daily — no change.
2. Continue alendronate 70 mg PO weekly. Counselled to ensure she uses at least 250 mL of plain water (not mineral water or coffee) when taking the tablet. Advised to avoid lying down for the full 30 minutes post-dose. If heartburn worsens or becomes persistent, to return sooner for reassessment — may need to consider switching to risedronate or IV zoledronic acid.
3. Continue vitamin D3 1000 IU daily and calcium carbonate 500 mg BID.
4. Prescription renewals provided: levothyroxine 88 mcg x 6 months; alendronate 70 mg x 6 months; vitamin D3 x 6 months.

## Encounter 4: 2025-04-10 — Fall Risk Assessment / Vitamin D Levels

- Date: 2025-04-10
- Time: 11:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton, ON)
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Fall risk assessment and vitamin D level review

### Subjective

Mrs. Rahimi presents for a fall risk assessment and review of vitamin D levels. She reports one near-fall event approximately 3 weeks ago — she tripped on an uneven sidewalk while walking near her home but caught herself on a railing. She did not fall to the ground and did not sustain any injury. She was wearing appropriate footwear at the time. She was not dizzy or lightheaded prior to the event. No other near-falls or falls.

She reports the occasional heartburn with alendronate has resolved — she has been more careful about water volume and posture, and has not experienced symptoms in the past 3 months.

She asks about whether her vitamin D dose is adequate, as a friend told her she should be taking 2000 IU daily. No new complaints otherwise. Energy good. Sleep adequate. Mood stable.

### Objective

Vitals:
- BP: 118/72 mmHg (sitting), 114/70 mmHg (standing at 1 minute) — no orthostatic hypotension
- HR: 74 bpm sitting, 78 bpm standing
- Weight: 59.5 kg
- Height: 157 cm (stable)

Fall risk assessment:
- Timed Up and Go (TUG): 10 seconds (normal < 12 seconds)
- Functional Reach Test: 28 cm (normal > 25 cm)
- Single leg stance: 18 seconds right, 16 seconds left (normal > 5 seconds; good for age)
- Visual acuity: 20/30 bilaterally with corrective lenses (last eye exam 2024-01)
- Footwear: Wears supportive flat shoes with non-slip soles
- Home hazards: Reports no loose rugs, has grab bars in bathroom, adequate lighting

MSK: No kyphosis. No vertebral tenderness. Good lower extremity strength bilaterally (5/5 hip flexion, knee extension, ankle dorsiflexion). No joint instability.

Lab results (drawn 2025-04-03):
- 25-OH Vitamin D: 64 nmol/L (ref 75-150; insufficient)
- Calcium (corrected): 2.32 mmol/L (ref 2.10-2.55)
- TSH: 2.9 mIU/L (ref 0.4-4.0)

### Assessment

1. **Fall risk** — Low to moderate risk given osteoporosis and age. TUG and functional balance tests are within normal limits. Near-fall was mechanical (environmental hazard) rather than intrinsic. No orthostatic hypotension. Good lower extremity strength and balance. Continue preventive strategies.
2. **Vitamin D insufficiency** — 25-OH Vitamin D has dropped to 64 nmol/L from 78 nmol/L one year ago. This is below the optimal threshold of 75 nmol/L recommended for patients with osteoporosis. Likely seasonal decline over winter months. Dose increase warranted.
3. **Hypothyroidism** — Well controlled. TSH 2.9, within target. No symptoms.
4. **Osteoporosis** — Stable management. Alendronate GI symptoms have resolved with improved technique.

### Plan

1. Increase vitamin D3 from 1000 IU to 2000 IU PO daily to achieve and maintain levels above 75 nmol/L, particularly through winter months. Recheck 25-OH vitamin D in 6 months.
2. Continue calcium carbonate 500 mg BID with meals.
3. Continue levothyroxine 88 mcg PO daily — no change.
4. Continue alendronate 70 mg PO weekly — no change.
5. Fall prevention: continue tai chi and daily walking. Advised vigilance on uneven terrain. Reviewed importance of annual eye exam — next due January 2025 (overdue — advised to book). Discussed home safety — patient reports appropriate modifications already in place.
6. Provided handout on fall prevention strategies from the Ontario Osteoporosis Strategy.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: In 5 months for annual physical and comprehensive thyroid/bone health review.
- Referrals: None. Advised to self-refer for optometry appointment.
