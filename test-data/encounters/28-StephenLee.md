- Practitioner: Dr. Robert Osei, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-65189)
- Reason for visit: Fall at home this morning with left wrist and left knee pain

### Subjective
Mr. Lee presents after a fall at home this morning. He reports he was coming downstairs and missed the last step, stumbling forward onto the hardwood floor. He landed on his outstretched left hand and left knee. He denies hitting his head. No loss of consciousness. No preceding dizziness, lightheadedness, palpitations, or chest pain. No visual changes. He was able to get up on his own. He walked to the clinic accompanied by his wife. He reports pain in the left wrist (3/10 currently) and mild left knee pain (2/10). He denies numbness or tingling in the left hand. He took acetaminophen 500 mg x2 at home with some relief. He was wearing socks on the stairs with no handrail use. This is his first fall in over a year.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 134/80 mmHg (sitting), 130/78 mmHg (standing — no orthostatic drop), HR 74 bpm regular, SpO2 97% RA
- General: Alert, oriented, in mild discomfort
- Head: No scalp tenderness, no hematoma, no lacerations
- Left wrist: Mild swelling over dorsal aspect; tender over distal radius; no obvious deformity; intact range of motion with discomfort on extension; grip strength intact; radial pulse 2+; sensation intact in median, ulnar, and radial distributions; no snuffbox tenderness
- Left knee: Small abrasion (2 cm) over patella, cleaned; mild tenderness over anterior patella; no effusion; full ROM with mild discomfort at end-range flexion; ligaments stable (Lachman negative, valgus/varus stable); McMurray negative
- Neurological: Alert, oriented x3; gait steady with mild left knee guarding; Romberg negative; no focal deficits
- Cardiovascular: Regular rhythm, no murmurs

### Assessment
1. Mechanical fall — tripped on stairs; no syncope, no orthostatic hypotension, no cardiac cause suspected; likely related to sock-clad feet on hardwood stairs without handrail use
2. Left wrist contusion/sprain — clinically no fracture suspected (no deformity, intact function); however, given age and mechanism (FOOSH), X-ray warranted to rule out distal radius fracture
3. Left knee contusion with minor abrasion — no ligamentous or meniscal injury clinically
4. Fall risk consideration — first fall in >1 year; mechanical etiology; warrants review of home safety and risk factors

### Plan
1. X-ray left wrist — requisition completed for Grand River Hospital radiology (walk-in); patient to go today
2. Left knee: cleaned and dressed abrasion; ice, elevation, acetaminophen PRN for comfort
3. If wrist X-ray negative for fracture: supportive care with wrist splint PRN, ice, acetaminophen; if fracture identified, ortho referral
4. Fall prevention counseling provided: use handrail on stairs at all times; avoid walking in socks on hard floors; consider non-slip slippers; review lighting on stairs
5. Reviewed medications — no sedating medications, no medications causing orthostatic hypotension; empagliflozin can cause volume depletion but orthostatic testing negative today
6. Follow up in 1-2 days for X-ray results; sooner if worsening pain, swelling, or inability to use hand

**Addendum (2024-09-23):** Left wrist X-ray — no fracture identified. Soft tissue swelling noted. Diagnosis: wrist sprain. Patient contacted by phone; advised supportive care, ice, acetaminophen, and gradual return to activity. Follow up at next scheduled visit or sooner if not improving.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 1-2 days for X-ray results (completed by phone; see addendum); formal follow-up at next scheduled visit (November 2024) to include fall risk assessment
- Referrals: Left wrist X-ray at Grand River Hospital (completed 2024-09-22)

- Weight: 71.6 kg, Height: 169 cm, BMI: 25.1
- General: Well-appearing elderly male
- Cardiovascular: Normal S1S2, no murmurs, no pedal edema, peripheral pulses intact
- Feet: Monofilament 10/10 bilaterally; no ulcers; skin intact; dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses 2+ bilaterally
- Thyroid: Normal size, no nodules
- Labs (fasting, drawn 2025-08-12):
  - A1c: 7.2%
  - Fasting glucose: 7.6 mmol/L
  - Creatinine: 93 umol/L, eGFR: 71 mL/min/1.73m2
  - Urine ACR: 2.5 mg/mmol (mildly elevated, trending up from 2.3 in April)
  - C-peptide: 1.8 nmol/L (normal; confirms adequate endogenous insulin production)
  - Fasting insulin: 68 pmol/L (mildly elevated; consistent with insulin resistance)
  - Lipids: LDL 1.8, HDL 1.3, TG 1.4 — at target

### Assessment
1. Type 2 diabetes mellitus — 13 years duration; A1c persistently 7.0-7.2% on metformin + empagliflozin; insulin resistant phenotype with adequate C-peptide; microvascular complications (mild NPDR, early nephropathy); no macrovascular events but high cardiovascular risk (age, family hx, diabetes duration)
2. Early diabetic nephropathy — ACR trending up (1.8 -> 2.3 -> 2.5 over 12 months); eGFR slowly declining (76 -> 71); on empagliflozin and ramipril (appropriate dual renoprotective strategy)
3. Mild NPDR — stable per ophthalmology
4. Cardiovascular risk — high; empagliflozin providing CV benefit (EMPA-REG OUTCOME data); statin at target

Current medications reviewed:
- Metformin 1000 mg BID — appropriate; renal function supports continued use (eGFR >30)
- Empagliflozin 10 mg daily — appropriate; cardio-renal benefit
- Atorvastatin 40 mg qHS — appropriate; LDL at target
- Ramipril 2.5 mg daily — appropriate; renoprotective
- Vitamin D3 1000 IU daily

### Plan
1. Add semaglutide (Ozempic) 0.25 mg SC weekly x 4 weeks, then titrate to 0.5 mg SC weekly — rationale: GLP-1 RA provides additional A1c lowering (expected 0.5-1.0% reduction), cardiovascular benefit (SUSTAIN-6, SELECT data), weight neutral-to-loss benefit, and complementary mechanism to current regimen; avoids hypoglycemia risk
2. Continue metformin 1000 mg BID, empagliflozin 10 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg qHS, ramipril 2.5 mg daily
3. Patient counseled on semaglutide: injection technique (abdomen/thigh, rotate sites), GI side effects (nausea most common — usually transient; eat smaller meals; stay hydrated), storage (refrigerate before first use; room temp up to 56 days after), when to seek care (severe abdominal pain — pancreatitis risk, though rare)
4. Target A1c <7.0%; reassess in 3-4 months after semaglutide titration
5. Consider uptitrating semaglutide to 1.0 mg weekly if 0.5 mg tolerated and A1c not at target after 3 months
6. Continue home glucose monitoring — fasting and occasional post-prandial
7. No insulin needed at this time — adequate endogenous production; oral + injectable GLP-1 RA should optimize control
8. Recheck A1c, renal function, and ACR in 3-4 months (via FP or return here)
9. Consultation report sent to Dr. Robert Osei

### Disposition
- Follow-up: Return to endocrine clinic in 6 months (February 2026) or sooner if issues with semaglutide; interim management with Dr. Osei
- Referrals: None; report to Dr. Osei

- Time: 11:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Kitchener-Waterloo Family Health Team, 200 King St W, Suite 400, Kitchener, ON
- Practitioner: Dr. Robert Osei, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-65189)
- Reason for visit: Follow-up after endocrinology consultation; semaglutide initiation review; A1c check

### Subjective
Mr. Lee returns for follow-up after his endocrinology consultation with Dr. Lam in August. He reports he started semaglutide (Ozempic) 0.25 mg weekly as directed and titrated to 0.5 mg weekly after 4 weeks. He experienced mild nausea during the first 2-3 weeks of each dose increase, which resolved. He is now tolerating 0.5 mg well. He has noticed reduced appetite and has lost approximately 2 kg since August. He denies abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea. Home fasting glucose readings have improved — mostly 6.5-7.5 mmol/L (previously 7-8). Postprandial readings have also improved, generally <9 mmol/L. No hypoglycemic episodes. He continues all other medications. He has been walking regularly. He received his Shingrix dose 2 in October at the pharmacy. No falls. Blood pressure at home has been averaging 125-130/75-78. He reports feeling well overall with good energy.
