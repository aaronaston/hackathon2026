## Encounter 1: 2024-03-12 — Annual Physical / Cognitive and Hypertension Review

- Date: 2024-03-12
- Time: 10:15
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton)
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Annual physical examination; review of hypertension management; daughter raised new concerns about memory

### Subjective

Eleanor presents for her annual physical accompanied by her daughter, Karen, who has been driving her from Welland. Karen reports that over the past six to eight months her mother has been repeating questions more frequently, misplacing items around the house, and occasionally forgetting whether she has taken her morning medication. Eleanor acknowledges some forgetfulness but attributes it to "just getting older." She denies any episodes of confusion, wandering, or personality changes. She is still managing her own meals and personal hygiene with minimal prompting.

Regarding hypertension, Eleanor reports no headaches, chest pain, or visual changes. She states she takes her amlodipine 5 mg daily, though Karen notes she sometimes finds the pill still sitting on the counter in the afternoon. No ankle swelling, no dizziness on standing. Eleanor denies falls. She has not been physically active beyond light housework and short walks. She continues to live with Karen and Karen's husband in their Welland home. Sleep is fair; she wakes once nightly to void.

Past medical history: Hypertension diagnosed 2011. No diabetes, stroke, or cardiac history. Appendectomy age 28. No psychiatric history.

Medications: Amlodipine 5 mg PO daily.

Allergies: No known drug allergies.

Social history: Non-smoker. Rare alcohol use (glass of wine on holidays). Retired elementary school teacher. Widowed 2017. Lives with daughter Karen (age 58) and son-in-law. Karen is primary support person and has durable power of attorney for personal care.

Family history: Mother had "dementia" in her late 80s (type uncertain). Father died of MI at age 74. One brother, alive, age 84, well.

### Objective

Vitals: BP 142/78 sitting right arm, 134/76 standing (no orthostatic symptoms), HR 72 regular, RR 14, Temp 36.4, SpO2 97% RA. Weight 57.4 kg, height 155 cm, BMI 23.9.

General: Pleasant, well-groomed elderly woman. Alert and cooperative. Oriented to person and place; hesitates briefly on date (states "March... 2024" after prompting).

HEENT: Pupils equal and reactive. Fundi — no papilledema, mild arteriolar narrowing. TMs clear. Oral mucosa moist, dentition fair.

Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs. JVP not elevated. Pedal pulses 2+ bilaterally. No peripheral edema.

Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No adventitious sounds.

Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly. Well-healed RLQ scar.

Neurological: Cranial nerves II-XII intact. Motor strength 5/5 in all extremities. Sensation intact to light touch. Deep tendon reflexes 2+ and symmetric. Gait steady but slow; able to tandem walk with mild unsteadiness. Romberg negative. No tremor. No focal deficits.

Brief cognitive screen (MoCA performed in office): Score 22/30. Lost points in: delayed recall (2/5), visuospatial/clock drawing (partial — numbers placed correctly but hands incorrect), serial 7s (1 error), abstraction (0/2). Orientation 6/6. Language and naming intact.

Screening labs ordered today: CBC, electrolytes, creatinine, fasting glucose, HbA1c, TSH, vitamin B12, folate, lipid panel, urinalysis.

### Assessment

1. **Subjective cognitive decline with objective deficits on MoCA (22/30)** — Pattern consistent with possible mild cognitive impairment (amnestic type). MoCA score below expected for education level (former teacher). Differential includes early Alzheimer disease, vascular cognitive impairment, depression, hypothyroidism, and B12 deficiency. Will await bloodwork to rule out reversible causes. Neurology referral indicated for formal cognitive assessment.

2. **Hypertension, currently suboptimally controlled** — BP 142/78 today. In the context of her age (87) and cognitive concerns, aggressive lowering is not warranted. Canadian Hypertension Guidelines recommend a target of < 150 systolic in frail elderly. Current BP is borderline acceptable. Will continue current dose and reassess once cognitive workup is complete.

3. **Medication adherence concerns** — Daughter reports missed doses. Will discuss strategies.

4. **Health maintenance** — Due for influenza vaccine (autumn). COVID-19 booster status reviewed. Bone density not recently assessed; low priority given current cognitive concerns.

### Plan

1. Cognitive concerns:
   - Bloodwork today: CBC, lytes, Cr, glucose, HbA1c, TSH, B12, folate, lipid panel, UA.
   - Referral to neurology — Dr. Brian Szabo at Hamilton General Hospital for formal cognitive assessment and consideration of neuroimaging.
   - Advised Karen to keep a diary of cognitive lapses (frequency, context, time of day).
   - PHQ-2 today: 0/6 — depression screen negative.

2. Hypertension:
   - Continue amlodipine 5 mg daily.
   - Home BP monitoring: Karen to check 2-3 times weekly and record.
   - Dietary sodium counselling provided.

3. Medication management:
   - Recommended a weekly dosette (pill organizer) prepared by Karen.
   - Discussed pharmacy blister packing as an alternative.
   - Karen to supervise morning medication intake.

4. General:
   - Reviewed fall prevention: adequate lighting, remove throw rugs, handrails in bathroom.
   - Encouraged daily walking with Karen or son-in-law.
   - Annual bloodwork and physical complete.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: Telephone call in two weeks to review bloodwork results; in-person follow-up in three months or sooner if neurology appointment occurs.
- Referrals: Neurology — Dr. Brian Szabo, Hamilton General Hospital.

## Encounter 2: 2024-05-14 — Neurology Consult — MCI Assessment, Cognitive Testing

- Date: 2024-05-14
- Time: 13:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Specialist Clinic
- Organization: Hamilton General Hospital — Neurology
- Practitioner: Dr. Brian Szabo, MD FRCPC (ON-PRAC-79864)
- Reason for visit: Referral from Dr. Moreau for formal cognitive assessment — concerns re: memory decline, MoCA 22/30

### Subjective

Eleanor presents with her daughter Karen for initial neurology consultation. Reviewed referral letter from Dr. Moreau. Karen reports the memory concerns have been present for approximately one year and are slowly progressing. Eleanor frequently asks the same questions within a 15-minute span, forgets recent conversations, and has difficulty recalling what she had for breakfast. She occasionally loses track of the day of the week. She has stopped reading novels, which she previously enjoyed, stating she "can't follow the plot." No episodes of getting lost. No behavioural or personality changes. No hallucinations or paranoia. No language difficulties noted by family. She continues to dress and bathe independently but Karen lays out her clothing. Karen now manages all finances and medication administration (using a dosette).

Eleanor herself states she "isn't as sharp" but feels generally well. She denies depressive symptoms, anxiety, and sleep disturbance. Appetite is stable. She has not had any falls, head injuries, or episodes of acute confusion.

Bloodwork from March reviewed: CBC normal. Cr 72 (eGFR 68 — mild CKD stage 2, age-appropriate). Electrolytes normal. Fasting glucose 5.4, HbA1c 5.6%. TSH 2.1 (normal). B12 412 pmol/L (normal). Folate normal. Lipid panel: TC 5.1, LDL 2.8, HDL 1.6, TG 1.5. Urinalysis unremarkable.

### Objective

Vitals: BP 138/74 sitting, HR 70 regular.

General: Well-appearing elderly woman. Cooperative and pleasant. Good hygiene. Accompanied by daughter.

Neurological examination:
- Mental status: Alert, oriented to person and place. States the month correctly ("May") but initially says the year is "2023" before self-correcting. Attentive during examination.
- Cranial nerves: II-XII grossly intact. Visual fields full to confrontation. No facial asymmetry.
- Motor: Normal bulk and tone. Strength 5/5 all extremities. No drift.
- Sensory: Intact to light touch, pinprick, vibration (mildly reduced at toes bilaterally — age-appropriate).
- Reflexes: 2+ and symmetric. Plantars flexor bilaterally.
- Coordination: Finger-nose and heel-shin intact. No dysmetria.
- Gait: Slightly cautious, narrow-based. Able to walk independently. Mild difficulty with tandem gait. Timed Up-and-Go: 14 seconds (mildly prolonged for age but within acceptable range).

Formal cognitive testing performed:

**MoCA (administered by neuropsychometry technician):** 21/30
- Visuospatial/Executive: 3/5 (trail-making errors, clock drawing — numbers correct, hands incorrect)
- Naming: 3/3
- Attention: 4/6 (serial 7s error, digit span forward intact, digit span backward — 1 error)
- Language: 2/3 (sentence repetition error)
- Abstraction: 1/2
- Delayed recall: 1/5 (recalled 1 of 5 words spontaneously, 2 with category cue, 1 with multiple choice)
- Orientation: 5/6 (year initially incorrect)

**MMSE:** 25/30 — Lost points on delayed recall (1/3), date (year), serial 7s (2 errors).

### Assessment

1. **Mild cognitive impairment, amnestic type, likely due to early Alzheimer disease** — Clinical history and cognitive testing profile are consistent with MCI. Predominant deficit is in delayed recall (episodic memory), which is the hallmark of amnestic MCI. MoCA 21/30 and MMSE 25/30 both corroborate mild impairment. Reversible causes have been excluded (B12, TSH, metabolic panel all normal). No features suggestive of vascular dementia (no stepwise decline, no focal deficits), frontotemporal dementia (no behavioural changes), or Lewy body dementia (no hallucinations, parkinsonism, or fluctuating cognition). CT head will be obtained to rule out structural pathology (chronic subdural, NPH, space-occupying lesion).

2. **Hypertension, managed** — BP reasonable today. No changes recommended from neurology perspective, though midlife and late-life hypertension is a risk factor for cognitive decline.

3. **Fall risk — low to moderate** — Timed Up-and-Go 14 seconds. Cautious gait. No falls to date.

### Plan

1. CT head without contrast — ordered today. To rule out structural pathology. Results will be communicated to Dr. Moreau.

2. Cholinesterase inhibitor therapy — Recommend initiating donepezil 5 mg PO at bedtime. Evidence supports modest benefit in MCI with amnestic features, and patient has no contraindications (no bradycardia, no peptic ulcer disease). Will defer prescription to Dr. Moreau for initiation and monitoring given her ongoing relationship with the patient.

3. Non-pharmacological recommendations:
   - Cognitive stimulation: puzzles, card games, reminiscence activities with family.
   - Physical activity: daily walking 20-30 minutes.
   - Social engagement: community programs, seniors' centre.
   - Mediterranean-style diet encouraged.

4. Driving assessment: Eleanor reports she stopped driving two years ago voluntarily. No concern at present. Documented.

5. Caregiver support: Discussed community resources with Karen including the Alzheimer Society of Hamilton-Halton and caregiver support groups. Provided pamphlets.

6. Consultation letter to Dr. Moreau will include recommendations.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: Neurology follow-up in 12-14 months to reassess cognitive trajectory, or sooner if significant decline.
- Referrals: CT head ordered (Hamilton General Hospital diagnostic imaging).

## Encounter 3: 2024-07-09 — FP Follow-up Post-Neurology — Donepezil Initiation

- Date: 2024-07-09
- Time: 09:45
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton)
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Follow-up on neurology consultation; review CT head results; discuss donepezil initiation

### Subjective

Eleanor and Karen return to review the neurology consultation results. Karen read the consultation letter and understands the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment. She asks whether this means her mother has Alzheimer's and expresses concern about the future. Eleanor seems less worried and states she feels "fine." Karen reports that cognitive symptoms are stable since March — continued repetitive questioning and occasional forgetfulness with daily tasks, but no major incidents. No falls. No wandering. No behavioural changes.

Karen asks about the recommended donepezil. She has looked it up online and has questions about side effects, particularly nausea and diarrhea. She wants to know if it will "fix" the memory problems or "just slow it down."

Eleanor reports no new symptoms. No chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations. Appetite is good. Bowel movements regular. Sleep unchanged. Karen has been using the dosette reliably and supervising morning amlodipine administration.

Home BP log reviewed: readings range 130-144 systolic, 70-80 diastolic over past two months. No orthostatic symptoms reported.

### Objective

Vitals: BP 136/76 sitting, HR 68 regular, weight 57.0 kg (stable).

CT head (2024-06-03) result reviewed: Mild generalized cerebral atrophy consistent with age. No acute intracranial pathology. No mass, midline shift, or hydrocephalus. No significant white matter disease. No old infarcts.

General: Well-appearing. Comfortable. Conversational. Oriented to person and place, correctly states month.

Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs. No bradycardia.

ECG performed in office: Normal sinus rhythm, rate 70, no conduction abnormalities. PR interval 168 ms. QTc 420 ms.

### Assessment

1. **Mild cognitive impairment (amnestic type)** — Neurology confirmed diagnosis. CT head shows age-appropriate atrophy without concerning structural pathology. Dr. Szabo recommends donepezil 5 mg. Patient is a reasonable candidate — no cardiac conduction disease on ECG, no GI contraindications. Will initiate today.

2. **Hypertension, reasonably controlled for age** — Home readings and office BP within acceptable range for frail elderly (< 150 systolic). No medication change needed.

3. **Caregiver education** — Karen is engaged and informed. Important to address expectations regarding donepezil.

### Plan

1. Donepezil initiation:
   - Donepezil 5 mg PO at bedtime — start tonight.
   - Counselled Eleanor and Karen: donepezil does not cure MCI or prevent progression to dementia, but may modestly improve or stabilize cognition in some patients. Benefits are typically modest. Medication will be continued as long as it is tolerated and there is no significant decline suggesting futility.
   - Side effects reviewed: nausea, diarrhea, vivid dreams, muscle cramps, dizziness, bradycardia. Advised to take at bedtime to minimize daytime GI effects. If vivid dreams or insomnia occur, can trial morning dosing.
   - Advised Karen to monitor for nausea, vomiting, loose stools, decreased appetite, and insomnia over the first 2-4 weeks.
   - Rx: Donepezil 5 mg PO qHS. Qty 90, 3 refills. Added to dosette.

2. Hypertension:
   - Continue amlodipine 5 mg daily.
   - Continue home BP monitoring.

3. Caregiver discussion:
   - Reviewed the difference between MCI and dementia. Explained that MCI may remain stable, progress to dementia, or in some cases improve.
   - Encouraged Karen to contact the Alzheimer Society as Dr. Szabo suggested.
   - Discussed importance of advance care planning — Eleanor has a POA for personal care (Karen) but has not completed a formal advance care plan. Raised the topic gently; Eleanor is open to discussing at a future visit.

4. NP follow-up in approximately 8 weeks to check medication tolerance and BP.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: NP Sandra Fleming in 8-10 weeks for donepezil tolerance check and BP review.
- Referrals: None.

---

## Encounter 4: 2024-09-10 — NP Visit — Medication Tolerance Check, BP

- Date: 2024-09-10
- Time: 11:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton)
- Practitioner: NP Sandra Fleming, MN NP-PHC (ON-NP-50312)
- Reason for visit: Donepezil tolerance check (started 8 weeks ago); BP review

### Subjective

Eleanor presents with Karen for a scheduled follow-up. Karen reports that the first two weeks after starting donepezil were "a bit rough." Eleanor experienced mild nausea, predominantly in the mornings, and had two episodes of loose stools in the first week. By week three the nausea had largely resolved. She has not had further diarrhea. No muscle cramps. Karen notes that Eleanor had a few nights of vivid dreams in the first 10 days but these settled. Sleep is now adequate — she falls asleep by 22:00 and wakes once nightly to void.

Regarding cognition, Karen feels that Eleanor's memory may be "a tiny bit better" but acknowledges it is hard to tell. She is still repeating questions but perhaps less frequently. Eleanor has started doing word-search puzzles, which Karen initiated based on the neurologist's advice. No new cognitive concerns. No episodes of confusion, agitation, or personality changes.

BP has been recorded at home: recent readings 128-140 systolic, 68-78 diastolic. No dizziness on standing. No falls.

Appetite has recovered after the initial nausea period. Weight feels stable. Bowel movements have returned to her usual pattern. No urinary symptoms.

Eleanor reports feeling "good." She says the puzzles are "fun."

### Objective

Vitals: BP 132/72 sitting, BP 128/70 standing (no orthostatic symptoms, no dizziness), HR 66 regular, weight 57.2 kg.

General: Well-appearing, pleasant. Oriented to person, place, and month. Good spirits.

Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No bradycardia. No new murmurs.

Abdomen: Soft, non-tender. Normal bowel sounds.

Medication reconciliation confirmed: Amlodipine 5 mg daily (morning) and Donepezil 5 mg at bedtime. Both administered by Karen via dosette. Pharmacy blister packing discussed again — Karen prefers the dosette for now.

### Assessment

1. **Donepezil 5 mg — tolerated well after initial GI side effects** — Nausea and loose stools resolved within 2-3 weeks, which is typical. No bradycardia (HR 66). No ongoing side effects. Subjective sense from caregiver of possible mild benefit. Will continue at current dose. No indication to increase to 10 mg at this time as per specialist recommendation for MCI.

2. **Hypertension — well controlled** — Home and office BP values within target range for elderly patient. No orthostatic hypotension on standing BP today. No changes.

3. **Functional status — stable** — ADLs maintained with Karen's supervision for medications. No falls.

### Plan

1. Continue donepezil 5 mg PO at bedtime.
2. Continue amlodipine 5 mg PO daily.
3. Encouraged continued cognitive stimulation activities (word searches, card games, conversation).
4. Reminded Karen about fall prevention measures.
5. Influenza vaccine administered today: Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent 0.7 mL IM left deltoid. Lot #FH4521, exp 2025-06. Patient observed 15 minutes, no immediate reaction. Documented in EMR and DHIR (Digital Health Immunization Repository).
6. Discussed advance care planning again — Karen will think about bringing it up with Eleanor in a comfortable setting before the next visit with Dr. Moreau.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: Dr. Moreau in approximately 3 months (December 2024) for comprehensive check-in.
- Referrals: None.

---

## Encounter 5: 2024-12-03 — FP Visit — Cognitive Status, Caregiver Check-in

- Date: 2024-12-03
- Time: 14:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton)
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Follow-up — cognitive status, caregiver well-being, medication review

### Subjective

Eleanor and Karen present for a scheduled visit. Karen reports that Eleanor's cognition has been "about the same" since September. She continues to repeat questions and occasionally forgets the names of less-familiar people but recognizes all family members. She had a good Thanksgiving with the extended family but became slightly overwhelmed by the noise and number of people, retreating to a quiet room after about an hour. Karen felt this was new — Eleanor was always very social.

Eleanor is continuing her word-search puzzles and has started watching a cooking show daily, which she enjoys. She helps Karen in the kitchen with simple tasks (peeling vegetables, stirring). She is still dressing and bathing independently. Karen continues to manage all medications via the dosette.

Karen appears tired today. When asked privately (Eleanor stepped out to use the washroom), Karen admits she is finding the caregiving role "more tiring than expected." She is not sleeping well, worrying about her mother at night. She has not looked into the Alzheimer Society support group yet. She denies depressive symptoms but acknowledges increased stress. She is still working part-time (administrative role, 3 days per week).

Eleanor denies any new physical complaints. No falls. No dizziness. No chest pain or shortness of breath. No urinary symptoms. Appetite fair — Karen notes she sometimes needs reminding to eat lunch. Sleep adequate.

Home BP log: 126-138 systolic, 68-76 diastolic.

### Objective

Vitals: BP 134/74 sitting, HR 68 regular, weight 56.8 kg (down 0.4 kg since September — minor, within normal fluctuation).

General: Well-groomed, pleasant. Slightly quieter than previous visits. Oriented to person and place; states the month is "November" (it is December). Corrects to December when told the date.

Brief cognitive reassessment (MoCA): 21/30. Essentially unchanged from May 2024. Deficits remain in delayed recall (1/5), visuospatial (3/5), and abstraction (1/2). Orientation 5/6 (month error).

Mood screen: PHQ-2 = 1/6 (endorses "little interest or pleasure" as "several days"). Does not meet threshold for further screening. Eleanor says she "just doesn't feel like doing as much." No suicidal ideation.

Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs. No edema.

Weight reviewed: 56.8 kg. Mild decrease. BMI 23.6. Not clinically significant but will monitor trend.

### Assessment

1. **Mild cognitive impairment — stable** — MoCA 21/30, unchanged from the neurology assessment six months ago. No functional decline in ADLs. Mild social withdrawal at Thanksgiving event may represent early sensitivity to overstimulation, which can occur in MCI. Donepezil appears to be tolerated and cognition is stable, which is the expected best-case outcome.

2. **Hypertension — well controlled** — No changes indicated.

3. **Mild anhedonia / reduced initiative** — PHQ-2 subthreshold. Not clearly depressive disorder. May represent apathy associated with MCI (a common neuropsychiatric feature). Will monitor. If worsening, consider formal depression screen and potential SSRI trial.

4. **Weight — mild downward trend** — 57.4 to 57.0 to 56.8 kg over 9 months. Not yet clinically concerning but worth monitoring given cognitive decline can lead to reduced oral intake.

5. **Caregiver burden** — Karen is showing early signs of caregiver stress and sleep disruption. Important to address proactively.

### Plan

1. Continue donepezil 5 mg at bedtime. Continue amlodipine 5 mg daily.
2. Cognitive stimulation: Encouraged continued activities. Suggested adding a simple daily routine board (whiteboard in kitchen with the date, day, weather, one planned activity) to provide orientation cues and structure.
3. Nutrition: Advised Karen to ensure three meals daily; Eleanor may need verbal reminders for lunch. Consider Ensure or Boost as a supplement if intake declines further. Will recheck weight in spring.
4. Advance care planning: Discussed again. Eleanor expressed willingness to "make sure Karen knows what I want." Provided the Speak Up Ontario advance care planning workbook. Suggested Eleanor and Karen work through it together at home and bring it back to discuss at the next annual physical.
5. Caregiver support:
   - Strongly encouraged Karen to contact the Alzheimer Society of Hamilton-Halton (provided phone number and website again).
   - Discussed respite options: adult day programs, in-home personal support worker (PSW) through Community Care Access / Ontario Health atHome.
   - Suggested Karen speak with her own family physician about her sleep and stress.
   - Validated Karen's efforts and the quality of care she is providing.
6. Neurology follow-up expected in summer 2025 — will coordinate timing.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: Annual physical with Dr. Moreau in April 2025; sooner if concerns arise.
- Referrals: None new. Encouraged caregiver self-referral to Alzheimer Society.

## Encounter 6: 2025-02-06 — Walk-in — UTI Symptoms

- Date: 2025-02-06
- Time: 16:20
- Type: Walk-in
- Setting: Walk-in Clinic
- Organization: Hamilton Medical Walk-in Centre
- Practitioner: Dr. Lisa Fernandes, MD
- Reason for visit: Acute dysuria, increased urinary frequency, and new-onset confusion

### Subjective

Karen brings Eleanor to the walk-in clinic (their FHT closed for the day). Karen reports that since yesterday evening, Eleanor has been urinating more frequently (every 1-2 hours) and complaining of burning with urination. This morning, Karen noticed that Eleanor seemed "more confused than usual" — she did not recognize the family cat and asked Karen repeatedly who she was, which has never happened before. She also seemed more unsteady on her feet. No fever that Karen is aware of, though she did not take a temperature. No flank pain, no hematuria noted. No vomiting. Oral intake has been reduced today — Eleanor drank only half a cup of tea this morning and refused lunch.

Karen provides background: Eleanor has MCI and takes donepezil 5 mg at bedtime and amlodipine 5 mg daily. No known drug allergies. Eleanor does not usually have urinary symptoms and has not had a UTI in years.

Eleanor is less conversational than described by Karen. She responds to questions but with some delay. She appears mildly agitated and is picking at her clothing.

### Objective

Vitals: BP 128/70 sitting, HR 82 regular, Temp 37.8 (oral), RR 16, SpO2 97% RA. Weight not obtained.

General: Elderly woman, appears mildly unwell. Restless, picking at clothing. Oriented to person only (cannot state place or date). More confused than baseline per daughter's report.

HEENT: Mucous membranes slightly dry. No neck stiffness.

Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs.

Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.

Abdomen: Soft. Mild suprapubic tenderness. No CVA tenderness. No guarding.

Neurological: No focal deficits. Moves all extremities. Gait not formally tested due to unsteadiness — Karen assisted her walking from the car.

Urinalysis (point-of-care dipstick): Leukocyte esterase 2+, nitrites positive, trace blood, no protein, no glucose.

CAM (Confusion Assessment Method) screen: Positive — acute onset (per Karen, since this morning), fluctuating course, inattention (difficulty counting backward from 20), disorganized thinking (tangential responses).

### Assessment

1. **Urinary tract infection with superimposed delirium** — Classic presentation in an elderly patient with baseline cognitive impairment. UTI is the most likely precipitant of the acute confusion. Delirium in the setting of MCI is concerning as it may accelerate cognitive decline and is associated with increased morbidity. The low-grade fever, suprapubic tenderness, positive UA, and CAM-positive delirium all support acute infection as the trigger.

2. **Dehydration, mild** — Reduced oral intake since yesterday. Dry mucous membranes. Likely contributing to the delirium.

3. **Fall risk — acutely elevated** — Unsteadiness plus delirium significantly increases fall risk.

### Plan

1. Urine culture sent (midstream clean-catch obtained with Karen's assistance).
2. Empiric antibiotic: Nitrofurantoin macrocrystals (Macrobid) 100 mg PO BID x 5 days. Chose nitrofurantoin over fluoroquinolone to avoid CNS side effects (seizure risk, worsened confusion) in elderly patient with cognitive impairment. Reviewed eGFR from March 2024 (68 mL/min) — adequate for nitrofurantoin. Rx provided.
3. Hydration: Advised Karen to encourage oral fluids aggressively — water, diluted juice, broth. Target at least 6-8 cups daily. If Eleanor is unable to maintain oral intake or confusion worsens, proceed to Emergency Department.
4. Delirium management:
   - Explained to Karen that the acute confusion is likely due to the infection and should improve with treatment.
   - Non-pharmacological strategies: quiet environment, reorientation cues, consistent routine, adequate lighting, avoid new medications.
   - No sedatives or antipsychotics indicated at this time.
5. Safety: Karen to supervise closely. Assist with ambulation. Remove tripping hazards.
6. Red flags reviewed with Karen: worsening confusion, fever > 38.5, inability to take fluids, vomiting antibiotics, flank pain, decreased urine output, falls — if any of these occur, go to Hamilton General Hospital Emergency.
7. Will fax encounter note to Dr. Moreau at Hamilton Mountain FHT tomorrow.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: Reassess in 48-72 hours — Karen to call FHT nurse line for update. If not improving, return to walk-in or go to Emergency. If urine culture results dictate antibiotic change, walk-in will contact Karen.
- Referrals: None. Encounter note to be communicated to Dr. Moreau.

## Encounter 7: 2025-04-08 — Annual Physical / Comprehensive Geriatric Review

- Date: 2025-04-08
- Time: 10:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton)
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Annual physical examination; comprehensive geriatric review; post-UTI/delirium follow-up

### Subjective

Eleanor and Karen present for the annual physical. Karen reports that the UTI in February was treated successfully — dysuria resolved within 48 hours and the acute confusion cleared over approximately 5 days. Urine culture (reviewed from walk-in note faxed to the FHT) grew E. coli sensitive to nitrofurantoin. Karen was "terrified" by the delirium episode and asks whether it has caused permanent damage. She notes that Eleanor's baseline cognition did return to roughly where it was before the UTI, though she wonders if she is "just a little bit worse."

Current cognitive status: Karen reports Eleanor's memory is "about the same as before the infection." She continues to repeat questions, forget recent events, and needs reminders for meals. She has had a few instances of putting items in unusual places (found the TV remote in the refrigerator twice). She remains oriented to family members and her home. She continues word-search puzzles but is completing them more slowly. She is no longer following the cooking show as closely — Karen suspects she has lost the thread of the recipes. ADLs: dressing independently with clothes laid out by Karen; bathing with standby assistance (Karen stays nearby); continent; mobility independent in the home with no falls since the UTI episode.

Karen reports she has contacted the Alzheimer Society and attended one caregiver support group meeting in March. She found it "helpful to talk to people who understand." She is sleeping slightly better.

Eleanor and Karen worked through the Speak Up Ontario advance care planning workbook. Eleanor states she would not want "extraordinary measures" if she were very ill and unlikely to recover. She wants to remain at home as long as possible. She trusts Karen to make decisions. They brought the partially completed workbook.

Eleanor denies pain, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, or urinary symptoms. She has been drinking more fluids as Karen has been vigilant since the UTI. Appetite is fair. Sleep adequate.

Home BP: 126-136 systolic, 68-76 diastolic.

### Objective

Vitals: BP 130/74 sitting, BP 126/70 standing (no orthostatic symptoms), HR 66 regular, RR 14, Temp 36.3, SpO2 97% RA. Weight 56.4 kg (down from 56.8 kg in December 2024 — cumulative 1 kg loss over one year).

General: Well-groomed, pleasant, conversational. Oriented to person and place. States the month correctly ("April"). Year correct ("2025").

HEENT: No abnormalities. Visual acuity: 20/40 OS, 20/30 OD with current glasses — stable.

Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs. No peripheral edema. Pedal pulses palpable.

Respiratory: Clear bilaterally.

Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no masses.

Musculoskeletal: Mild kyphosis. Full ROM upper and lower extremities. Grip strength fair bilaterally.

Neurological: No focal deficits. Gait slightly more cautious than last year but no assistive device needed. Timed Up-and-Go: 15 seconds (mildly prolonged from 14 seconds at neurology, May 2024). Romberg negative.

MoCA: 20/30. Delayed recall 1/5. Visuospatial 2/5 (clock drawing more disorganized — numbers bunched on one side). Attention 4/6. Abstraction 1/2. Language 3/3. Naming 3/3. Orientation 6/6.

PHQ-2: 1/6 — same as December. Subthreshold.

Functional assessment — Katz ADL: 6/6 (independent in bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, continence, feeding, though some require prompting or standby assistance). Lawton IADL: 3/8 (dependent in finances, medication management, shopping, transportation, meal preparation; independent in telephone use, laundry with supervision, light housekeeping with supervision).

Annual bloodwork results (drawn 2025-03-25): CBC normal. Cr 76 (eGFR 64). Electrolytes normal. Glucose 5.6. HbA1c 5.7%. TSH 2.3. B12 398 pmol/L. Lipid panel stable. Vitamin D 62 nmol/L (borderline low). Urinalysis: clear, no leukocytes, no nitrites.

### Assessment

1. **Mild cognitive impairment — very slow progression** — MoCA declined from 22 (March 2024) to 21 (May 2024) to 21 (December 2024) to 20 (today). One-point decline over one year is within test-retest variability, but the qualitative observations (deteriorating clock drawing, slower puzzle completion, reduced ability to follow the cooking show, items in unusual places) suggest subtle progression. Still within MCI range — not yet meeting criteria for dementia (ADLs remain largely intact though IADLs are significantly impaired, which predates the current cognitive concerns for some items like driving and finances). Post-delirium cognitive effects are possible but Eleanor appears to have returned to near-baseline.

2. **Hypertension — well controlled** — BP excellent for age. No changes.

3. **Weight loss, mild but persistent** — 57.4 to 56.4 kg over 13 months (1 kg, ~1.7%). Not yet meeting criteria for clinically significant weight loss (> 5% in 6-12 months) but trending downward. Likely multifactorial: reduced appetite with MCI, forgetting meals. Will monitor and intervene if continues.

4. **Vitamin D insufficiency** — 62 nmol/L. Supplementation reasonable for bone health and fall prevention in elderly.

5. **Fall risk — moderate** — Timed Up-and-Go 15 seconds. Cautious gait. MCI. History of delirium-related unsteadiness. No falls to date but risk is increasing.

6. **Advance care planning — in progress** — Eleanor has expressed clear goals of care. Will formalize.

7. **Caregiver burden — improving** — Karen engaging with Alzheimer Society. Sleep improving.

### Plan

1. Medications:
   - Continue donepezil 5 mg at bedtime.
   - Continue amlodipine 5 mg daily.
   - Add vitamin D3 1000 IU PO daily.

2. Cognition:
   - Continue cognitive stimulation. Suggested Music and Memory program (familiar music from her era).
   - Neurology follow-up with Dr. Szabo — will send updated note and MoCA scores. Expected follow-up summer 2025.

3. Nutrition:
   - Discussed importance of maintaining weight. Karen to ensure three meals and one snack daily.
   - If weight continues to decline, will consider dietitian referral and oral nutritional supplements.
   - Recheck weight at next visit.

4. Fall prevention:
   - Reviewed home safety again. Recommended bathroom grab bars if not already installed.
   - Encouraged daily walking (supervised).
   - Vitamin D supplementation (as above) for bone health.
   - Discussed hip protectors — Karen to consider.

5. Advance care planning:
   - Reviewed workbook together. Eleanor confirmed: she wishes comfort-focused care if she develops severe dementia or a life-threatening illness with poor prognosis. She does not want CPR or mechanical ventilation in that context. She wants to remain at home as long as safely possible. Karen is her substitute decision-maker.
   - Documented goals of care in the EMR.
   - Will formalize with a Goals of Care Designation at next visit (once Karen and Eleanor have had further discussion about hospital-level interventions).

6. Immunizations:
   - COVID-19 booster discussed — Eleanor had her last booster in 2024. Updated booster recommended this fall.

7. Caregiver:
   - Validated Karen's attendance at the Alzheimer Society group.
   - Encouraged ongoing attendance and exploration of respite services.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: Neurology follow-up anticipated July 2025. FP visit October 2025 or sooner if concerns arise.
- Referrals: Updated note to Dr. Szabo for neurology follow-up.

## Encounter 8: 2025-07-15 — Neurology Follow-up — Cognitive Trajectory

- Date: 2025-07-15
- Time: 14:15
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Specialist Clinic
- Organization: Hamilton General Hospital — Neurology
- Practitioner: Dr. Brian Szabo, MD FRCPC (ON-PRAC-79864)
- Reason for visit: 14-month follow-up — reassess cognitive trajectory on donepezil; review updated MoCA and clinical course

### Subjective

Eleanor presents with Karen for neurology follow-up. Reviewed Dr. Moreau's updated note including MoCA scores over time (22, 21, 21, 20) and clinical observations. Karen reports that Eleanor's cognition has been "gradually slipping" but slowly. Main concerns since the April visit:

- Repetitive questioning is somewhat more frequent, particularly in the evenings ("sundowning" pattern — Karen has noticed Eleanor becomes more confused after dinner, asking where her husband is, though he passed away in 2017).
- She had a brief episode last month where she did not recognize Karen's husband (her son-in-law of 30 years) and became mildly agitated, asking who "that man" was. This resolved after about 30 minutes. Karen found this very distressing.
- She is having more difficulty with word-finding, pausing mid-sentence to search for words, though she can usually get the word after a delay or with a cue.
- She is still dressing with clothes laid out but now occasionally puts items on incorrectly (shirt backward, two socks on one foot).

No falls. No incontinence. No seizures. No hallucinations other than the misidentification episode. No aggression.

Donepezil has been tolerated without side effects since the initial GI symptoms resolved over a year ago. No muscle cramps, no syncope.

Karen asks whether it is time to consider a higher dose of donepezil or a different medication.

### Objective

Vitals: BP 136/76 sitting, HR 64 regular.

General: Pleasant, cooperative. Less spontaneously conversational than the 2024 visit. Responds appropriately to direct questions but does not elaborate. Occasionally looks to Karen for confirmation.

Neurological examination:
- Mental status: Alert. Oriented to person and city but not to date (states "July" but says the year is "2024"). Attentive to simple commands; mild difficulty with multi-step instructions.
- Cranial nerves: Intact.
- Motor: Normal bulk and tone. No rigidity. No cogwheeling. Strength 5/5.
- Sensory: Reduced vibration at toes bilaterally (unchanged).
- Reflexes: 2+ and symmetric. Plantars flexor.
- Gait: Cautious, mildly wide-based compared to last year. Timed Up-and-Go: 16 seconds. No shuffling. No festination. No freezing.

Cognitive testing:

**MoCA:** 18/30
- Visuospatial/Executive: 1/5 (trail-making incomplete, clock drawing significantly impaired — numbers 1-12 present but poorly spaced, hands absent)
- Naming: 3/3
- Attention: 3/6 (serial 7s — 2 errors, digit span forward intact, backward failed)
- Language: 2/3 (fluency reduced — 7 words starting with "F" in 1 minute)
- Abstraction: 0/2
- Delayed recall: 1/5 (1 with category cue, 0 spontaneous)
- Orientation: 4/6 (year and day of week incorrect)

**MMSE:** 22/30 (declined from 25 in May 2024). Lost points: recall (0/3), date (2/5), serial 7s (3/5), three-step command (2/3).

### Assessment

1. **Progression from mild cognitive impairment to mild dementia, likely Alzheimer type** — Over 14 months, MoCA has declined from 21 to 18 and MMSE from 25 to 22. More importantly, there is now clear functional decline: difficulty with dressing (BADL), evening confusion/sundowning, transient misidentification of familiar people, and reduced verbal fluency. These findings cross the threshold from MCI to mild dementia. The pattern remains consistent with Alzheimer disease: progressive amnestic deficit with expanding involvement of visuospatial, executive, and language domains. No features of Lewy body dementia (no persistent visual hallucinations, no parkinsonism, no fluctuating consciousness). No features of frontotemporal dementia.

2. **Sundowning** — Evening confusion with deceased-spouse phenomenon is common in early AD. Non-pharmacological management is first-line.

3. **Donepezil therapy — consider continuation vs. dose adjustment** — Patient has been on donepezil 5 mg for 12 months. Cognition has declined, but the rate of decline has been relatively gradual, which may reflect partial treatment benefit. Options include increasing to 10 mg (risk of GI side effects) or adding memantine (typically reserved for moderate-to-severe dementia, but some evidence for combination in mild-moderate AD). At this stage, I recommend maintaining donepezil 5 mg and reassessing. The evidence for increasing the dose in mild dementia is modest, and the risk of GI side effects may impact quality of life.

4. **Fall risk — increasing** — Timed Up-and-Go 16 seconds. Wider-based gait. Dementia itself is a fall risk factor.

### Plan

1. Diagnosis communicated to Eleanor and Karen: Explained that Eleanor's condition has progressed from mild cognitive impairment to mild Alzheimer-type dementia. Karen was tearful but stated she "expected this was coming." Eleanor appeared calm and said "I know I'm not as good as I was." Spent time discussing the diagnosis, expected trajectory, available supports, and maintaining quality of life.

2. Medications:
   - Continue donepezil 5 mg at bedtime. Not recommending dose increase at this time; risk of GI side effects outweighs likely benefit in mild dementia.
   - Memantine not indicated yet — reserve for moderate stage.
   - No antipsychotics or sedatives for sundowning — behavioural management first-line.

3. Sundowning management:
   - Consistent daily routine, especially in the afternoon and evening.
   - Adequate daytime activity and light exposure.
   - Calm, low-stimulation environment in the evenings.
   - Night light in bedroom and hallway.
   - If Eleanor asks about her husband, gentle redirection rather than correcting her (do not repeatedly tell her he has passed away, as this causes fresh grief each time). Validate her feelings: "Tell me about him."
   - If sundowning worsens significantly (agitation, aggression, safety concerns), may consider low-dose trazodone at bedtime.

4. Driving: Confirmed — Eleanor has not driven in over 3 years. No concern.

5. Safety:
   - MedicAlert bracelet recommended in case of wandering (though not currently an issue).
   - Door alarms or locks discussed with Karen — not needed yet but good to plan.
   - Fall prevention measures reinforced.

6. Consultation letter to Dr. Moreau with updated diagnosis and recommendations.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: Neurology reassessment in 12 months (July 2026) or sooner if rapid decline, behavioural issues, or safety concerns. Karen has clinic phone number for interim concerns.
- Referrals: None new. Encouraged continued engagement with Alzheimer Society.

## Encounter 9: 2025-10-21 — FP Visit — Medication Review, Advance Care Planning Discussion

- Date: 2025-10-21
- Time: 10:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton)
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Follow-up — review neurology consultation, medication review, advance care planning, caregiver check-in

### Subjective

Eleanor and Karen return for follow-up. Karen received and read the neurology letter from Dr. Szabo confirming the diagnosis of mild Alzheimer-type dementia. She has had time to process and says she is "coming to terms with it." She has attended three more Alzheimer Society caregiver group meetings and finds them very supportive.

Karen reports that Eleanor's cognition is "a bit worse since the summer, but slowly." The sundowning episodes occur 3-4 evenings per week, typically lasting 30-60 minutes. During these episodes, Eleanor becomes mildly anxious and asks about her husband or says she "needs to go home" (even though she is at home). Karen has been using redirection and validation as Dr. Szabo recommended, and finds this effective most of the time. There have been no episodes of agitation or aggression.

New concern: Eleanor has had two near-falls in the past month — once when turning quickly in the bathroom and once when getting up from a chair. She did not hit the ground either time (caught herself on furniture/wall) but Karen is worried. No actual falls, no injuries.

Eleanor is now needing standby assistance for bathing (Karen stays in the bathroom) and verbal prompting for dressing. She requires reminders to eat and drink. Continence is maintained but she sometimes has urgency and Karen ensures she gets to the bathroom promptly. She continues to recognize all family members consistently. She enjoys music — Karen has been playing songs from the 1950s and 1960s and Eleanor sings along, which Karen finds reassuring.

Eleanor herself says she is "doing okay" but seems less engaged in conversation. She defers to Karen for most answers.

Medications: Donepezil 5 mg at bedtime, amlodipine 5 mg daily, vitamin D3 1000 IU daily — all administered by Karen.

Home BP: 124-136 systolic, 66-76 diastolic.

### Objective

Vitals: BP 130/72 sitting, BP 120/66 standing (mild orthostatic drop but no symptoms — Eleanor denies dizziness, no unsteadiness on standing), HR 62 regular, Temp 36.3, SpO2 97% RA. Weight 55.8 kg (down from 56.4 kg in April — 1.6 kg total loss from baseline of 57.4 kg over 19 months, approximately 2.8%).

General: Appears well. Somewhat less engaged than previous visits. Makes eye contact, smiles. Oriented to person and city. Cannot state the date or month (guesses "September"). Clean, appropriately dressed.

Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs. No edema. HR 62 — borderline low but not symptomatic.

Neurological: No focal deficits. Gait observed in hallway: cautious, slightly wide-based, hesitant with turns. No shuffling or festination.

Medication review:
- Donepezil 5 mg: tolerated. HR 62 — will monitor for further bradycardia. No GI symptoms.
- Amlodipine 5 mg: BP well controlled, possibly contributing to mild orthostatic drop. Given standing BP 120/66 without symptoms, current dose is acceptable but must monitor carefully.
- Vitamin D3 1000 IU: no issues.

No bloodwork done today — will defer to annual cycle in spring 2026.

### Assessment

1. **Mild Alzheimer-type dementia — slowly progressive** — Functional decline continues (near-falls, increased need for ADL support, reduced engagement). Sundowning present but manageable. Still in the mild stage: recognizes family, continent, mobile, able to communicate.

2. **Fall risk — moderate to high** — Two near-falls in one month. Contributing factors: dementia (impaired judgment, spatial disorientation), cautious gait, possible orthostatic hypotension (asymptomatic), advancing age (86). This is the single highest priority for safety.

3. **Orthostatic hypotension, mild, asymptomatic** — Sitting 130/72, standing 120/66. Systolic drop of 10 mmHg does not meet formal orthostatic criteria (> 20 mmHg) but the standing BP is on the low side for an elderly patient with fall risk. Must weigh BP control against fall risk.

4. **Weight loss, progressive** — Now 2.8% over 19 months. Approaching concern threshold. Appetite reduction likely related to dementia.

5. **Advance care planning — to formalize** — Previous conversations have established Eleanor's wishes. Time to formalize.

6. **Medication simplification** — Important principle in geriatric dementia care: minimize polypharmacy, reduce fall-risk medications, ensure each medication has a clear ongoing indication.

### Plan

1. Fall prevention (priority):
   - Referral to Ontario Health atHome (formerly CCAC) for occupational therapy home safety assessment.
   - Bathroom: grab bars (if not done), non-slip mat, raised toilet seat if needed.
   - Encouraged Karen to assist with all transfers and turns.
   - Discussed hip protectors again — Karen agrees to trial.
   - Low-heeled, non-slip footwear.
   - If falls occur (not just near-falls), will consider physiotherapy referral and further workup.

2. Blood pressure and orthostatic risk:
   - Given asymptomatic mild orthostatic drop and increasing fall risk, will maintain amlodipine 5 mg for now but with lower threshold to reduce or discontinue if standing BP drops further or if a fall occurs.
   - Karen to check standing BP at home weekly.
   - Counselled on positional changes: rise slowly, sit on bed edge before standing, use furniture for support.

3. Donepezil:
   - Continue 5 mg at bedtime. HR 62 is acceptable. If HR drops below 55 or symptoms of bradycardia develop (dizziness, syncope, presyncope), discontinue and contact clinic.

4. Weight management:
   - Encouraged nutrient-dense snacks between meals (cheese, yogurt, nuts if no choking risk).
   - Started Boost Original 1 can daily as a supplement (237 mL, 240 kcal, 10 g protein).
   - Will reassess weight in February at NP visit.

5. Advance care planning:
   - Formalized Goals of Care Designation in EMR:
     - Eleanor Davis wishes comfort-focused care in the context of advanced illness with poor prognosis.
     - She does not want CPR, mechanical ventilation, or ICU admission if she is in the late stages of dementia or has a life-limiting acute illness.
     - She wishes to remain at home as long as safely possible.
     - Substitute decision-maker: Karen Davis (daughter), POA for personal care.
   - Printed and provided a copy for Karen.
   - Discussed that these wishes can be revisited at any time.
   - Discussed the possibility of future long-term care placement if home care becomes unsustainable — Eleanor stated she "hopes it doesn't come to that" but understands it may be necessary. Karen is open to discussing when the time comes.

6. Caregiver:
   - Karen is managing well with Alzheimer Society support.
   - Encouraged ongoing attendance and discussed respite options again (adult day program, PSW hours through Ontario Health atHome).
   - Karen states she may request PSW support "in a few months" — she is managing for now.

7. Influenza vaccine: Administered today — Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent 0.7 mL IM left deltoid. Lot #FH5622, exp 2026-06. No immediate reaction. Documented in EMR and DHIR.

8. COVID-19 booster: Recommended. Karen will arrange through pharmacy.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: NP Sandra Fleming in approximately 4 months (February 2026) for BP check, weight, medication renewal, functional status.
- Referrals: Ontario Health atHome — OT home safety assessment.

---

## Encounter 10: 2026-02-10 — NP Visit — BP Check, Medication Renewal, Functional Status

- Date: 2026-02-10
- Time: 09:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton)
- Practitioner: NP Sandra Fleming, MN NP-PHC (ON-NP-50312)
- Reason for visit: Scheduled follow-up — BP check, weight monitoring, medication renewal, functional status review

### Subjective

Eleanor presents with Karen for a scheduled NP follow-up. Karen reports that the Ontario Health atHome OT assessment was completed in December 2025. Grab bars have been installed in the bathroom (tub and beside toilet), a raised toilet seat was provided, and non-slip mats were placed in the bathroom and kitchen. Karen feels the home is "much safer now."

Regarding cognition and function: Karen reports continued slow decline. Eleanor now requires hands-on assistance with bathing (Karen washes her back and hair; Eleanor can wash her face and torso with prompting). She needs Karen to lay out clothes and assist with buttons and zippers. She is continent during the day with frequent prompting to use the bathroom, but has had two episodes of overnight urinary incontinence in the past month (Karen suspects she cannot find the bathroom in the dark; installed a night light in the hallway). She eats meals prepared by Karen with reminders to continue eating (she sometimes stops mid-meal and needs verbal cues). She enjoys the Boost supplement and asks for it by name — "my drink."

Eleanor has had one fall since October — in January, she tripped on the threshold between the kitchen and hallway and fell to her knees. No head strike. No loss of consciousness. Karen helped her up. She had mild knee bruising that resolved in a week. No other falls. The near-falls have not recurred since the home modifications.

Sundowning continues 3-4 evenings per week, unchanged in severity. Managed with redirection and music. No aggression. No wandering beyond the house. Eleanor occasionally tries to "go home" in the evenings but is easily redirected.

Karen has started receiving PSW support through Ontario Health atHome: a personal support worker comes 3 mornings per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) to assist with Eleanor's morning routine, which allows Karen some time for herself. Karen says this has "made a huge difference."

Eleanor is quiet today. She smiles when greeted, says "good morning," and recognizes the NP from previous visits. She answers "I'm fine" to most questions and looks to Karen for elaboration.

Medications: Donepezil 5 mg at bedtime, amlodipine 5 mg daily, vitamin D3 1000 IU daily, Boost Original 1 can daily. All administered by Karen.

Home BP: 122-134 systolic, 64-74 diastolic sitting. Standing readings: 118-128 systolic. Karen reports no dizziness or complaints from Eleanor when standing, though she notes Eleanor does not always report symptoms reliably anymore.

### Objective

Vitals: BP 130/74 sitting right arm, BP 122/68 standing (systolic drop 8 mmHg — does not meet formal orthostatic criteria; Eleanor denies dizziness, no visible unsteadiness during measurement), HR 60 regular, RR 14, Temp 36.2, SpO2 97% RA. Weight 55.2 kg.

General: Appears comfortable and well-groomed. Less spontaneously verbal than previous visits. Oriented to person (states her name, recognizes Karen and the NP). Unable to state the month or year. Pleasant affect, smiles appropriately.

Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. HR 60 — lower than previous visits (was 62 in October, 66 in September 2024). No murmurs. No peripheral edema.

Abdomen: Soft, non-tender. Normal bowel sounds.

Skin: No pressure injuries. No bruising. Knees examined — no residual bruising or tenderness from January fall.

Gait: Observed walking in clinic hallway with Karen at her side. Slow, slightly wide-based, cautious with turns. No shuffling. Uses Karen's arm for balance.

Functional reassessment:
- Katz ADL: 4/6 (requires assistance with bathing and dressing; independent with supervision in toileting, transferring, feeding; continent with prompting, though occasional nocturnal incontinence).
- Lawton IADL: 1/8 (dependent in all categories except can use telephone to answer — does not initiate calls).

Medication review:
- Donepezil 5 mg: HR 60 — trending lower (66 → 62 → 60 over 16 months). No symptomatic bradycardia. Will flag for Dr. Moreau.
- Amlodipine 5 mg: BP sitting 130/74, standing 122/68. Mild but stable orthostatic trend. No symptoms. Adequate control.
- Vitamin D3 1000 IU: no concerns.
- Boost Original: good adherence.

### Assessment

1. **Alzheimer-type dementia — progression from mild to mild-moderate** — Functional decline continues. ADL impairment now extends to bathing and dressing. IADL nearly fully dependent. Occasional nocturnal incontinence (likely functional — cannot navigate to bathroom). Verbal output reduced. However, she remains mobile, recognizes family, is pleasant and cooperative, and quality of life appears reasonable with current supports.

2. **Fall — one fall since October** — Mechanical trip on threshold. Home modifications have helped reduce near-fall episodes. Fall risk remains elevated due to dementia, age, and gait instability. The single fall without significant injury is reassuring but vigilance is required.

3. **Orthostatic hypotension — stable, asymptomatic** — Systolic drop 8 mmHg. Not worsening. Eleanor is unable to reliably report dizziness, so objective monitoring and observation are essential.

4. **Donepezil — HR trend** — HR has declined from 66 to 60 over 16 months. Donepezil can cause bradycardia. HR 60 is at the lower threshold of acceptable. Not currently symptomatic. Will flag for Dr. Moreau to decide on continuation vs. ECG monitoring vs. discontinuation discussion. Given disease progression, it is also reasonable to discuss whether donepezil is still providing meaningful benefit — this is a nuanced conversation for Dr. Moreau's next visit.

5. **Weight — continued slow decline** — 57.4 → 55.2 kg over 23 months (3.8% total loss). Approaching 5% threshold for clinically significant weight loss. Boost supplementation is being taken. May need to increase caloric intake or add a second supplement.

6. **Nocturnal incontinence — likely functional** — Overnight navigation difficulty. Night light installed. May need further strategies.

7. **Caregiver and home supports — improved** — PSW support in place. Karen attending Alzheimer Society. Coping well. Home modifications completed.

### Plan

1. Medications — renewed:
   - Donepezil 5 mg PO at bedtime — renewed, 90 days. Flagged HR trend for Dr. Moreau. Advised Karen: if Eleanor has any episodes of dizziness, syncope, or presyncope, hold donepezil and contact clinic urgently.
   - Amlodipine 5 mg PO daily — renewed, 90 days. Continue monitoring standing BP at home.
   - Vitamin D3 1000 IU PO daily — renewed.

2. Nutrition and weight:
   - Weight 55.2 kg — will track at every visit.
   - Encouraged increasing caloric density of meals (add butter, cheese, cream to foods).
   - If weight drops below 54 kg or reaches 5% loss (54.5 kg), consider adding a second Boost daily or dietitian referral.
   - Karen to continue supervised meals with verbal prompting.

3. Fall prevention:
   - Home modifications in place — good.
   - Addressed threshold where fall occurred — Karen reports it has been covered with a flat transition strip.
   - Eleanor should always have someone within arm's reach when mobilizing, especially on stairs (Karen reports they do not use stairs — main floor only).
   - Discussed whether physiotherapy for strength and balance would be helpful. Will raise with Dr. Moreau.

4. Nocturnal incontinence:
   - Night light in hallway installed (confirmed).
   - Recommended a commode at bedside for nighttime use — will arrange through Ontario Health atHome if available, or Karen can purchase.
   - Encouraged toileting immediately before bed.
   - If incontinence becomes regular, consider incontinence briefs for overnight to protect skin and reduce Karen's laundry burden.

5. Immunizations:
   - Influenza: received October 2025 (current season — up to date).
   - COVID-19 booster: Karen reports it was administered at the pharmacy in November 2025. Documented in EMR.

6. Follow-up items for Dr. Moreau (next visit):
   - Donepezil continuation discussion: HR trend, disease progression, risk-benefit analysis.
   - Possible amlodipine dose reduction if fall risk worsens or orthostatic drop increases.
   - Consider repeat bloodwork including Cr (monitor kidney function — last eGFR 64), CBC, and albumin (nutritional status).
   - Physiotherapy referral for gait and balance training.
   - Ongoing advance care planning review as disease progresses.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: Dr. Moreau in approximately 3-4 months (May-June 2026) for comprehensive review, medication decisions, and annual bloodwork.
- Referrals: Bedside commode request through Ontario Health atHome.
