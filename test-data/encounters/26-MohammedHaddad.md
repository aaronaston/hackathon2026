### Assessment
1. **COPD, moderate (GOLD Stage II)** — clinically stable. Baseline dyspnea is mMRC grade 1. No exacerbations since last annual review. Maintenance therapy with tiotropium appears effective. Spirometry last performed 2022 — due for repeat PFTs to confirm staging and trend FEV1.
2. **Smoking cessation maintenance** — tobacco-free since 2018 (6 years). Reinforced.
3. **Preventive health** — influenza vaccine up to date. Pneumococcal vaccine status unclear; recommend Pneu-P-23 if not previously received. Colorectal cancer screening — FIT due (last 2022). Age-appropriate cancer screening otherwise up to date.
4. **Cardiovascular risk** — pending labs. BMI 26.3 (overweight). BP at target.

### Plan
1. Continue tiotropium bromide 2.5 mcg 2 puffs inhaled daily and salbutamol PRN.
2. Referral to respirology for repeat pulmonary function tests and COPD reassessment — will refer to Dr. Michael Torres at Hamilton General Hospital Respirology given Northern Ontario access; patient agreeable to travel.
3. Administer Pneu-P-23 today (administered: left deltoid, Lot# PV8834, Exp 2025-06).
4. Order FIT kit for colorectal cancer screening — provided to patient with requisition.
5. Review bloodwork results at next visit or by phone if urgent.
6. Reinforce daily walking; discussed benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation — will revisit pending respirology input.
7. Encourage continued tobacco abstinence.

### Disposition

- Time: 13:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Specialist Clinic
- Organization: Hamilton General Hospital — Respirology (237 Barton St E, Hamilton, ON)
- Practitioner: Dr. Michael Torres, MD FRCPC (ON-PRAC-77108)
- Reason for visit: Respirology consultation — COPD reassessment, pulmonary function testing

### Subjective
Mohammed was referred by Dr. Chakraborty for repeat PFTs and COPD staging. He travelled from Sudbury for this appointment. He reports stable chronic dyspnea on moderate exertion (e.g., two flights of stairs, brisk walking on inclines). He describes a chronic morning cough productive of small amounts of white/clear sputum. No recent change in sputum colour or volume. No hemoptysis. He uses his salbutamol rescue inhaler approximately 2-3 times per week, mostly before physical activity. He denies nocturnal awakenings due to cough or dyspnea. No chest tightness at rest. No history of asthma in childhood. No occupational exposures beyond previous mining-adjacent work in Sudbury (office-based, not underground). Quit smoking in 2018 after 40 pack-years. No recent respiratory infections. No weight loss or appetite change. He walks 20 minutes daily and reports he can complete this without stopping, though he notes being slightly more winded on cold days.

### Objective
- **Vitals:** BP 134/80 mmHg, HR 76 bpm, RR 16, SpO2 95% on RA, Weight 77.1 kg.
- **General:** Alert, comfortable at rest, no accessory muscle use, no pursed-lip breathing.
- **Respiratory:** Chest mildly hyperinflated (increased AP diameter). Bilateral diffuse expiratory wheeze, low-pitched. Air entry reduced at both bases. No crackles. No rhonchi.
- **Cardiovascular:** Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs. No peripheral edema.
- **Extremities:** No clubbing, no cyanosis.

- **Pulmonary Function Tests (pre-bronchodilator):**
  - FVC: 3.42 L (82% predicted)
  - FEV1: 1.89 L (62% predicted)
  - FEV1/FVC ratio: 0.55 (reduced)
  - TLC: 7.10 L (112% predicted) — mild hyperinflation
  - DLCO: 68% predicted — mildly reduced
  - RV: 3.68 L (138% predicted) — air trapping

- **Post-bronchodilator (salbutamol 400 mcg):**
  - FEV1: 1.98 L (65% predicted) — improvement of 90 mL (4.8%), not significant (<12% and <200 mL change would indicate non-reversible, but this is borderline; clinically consistent with COPD rather than asthma)
  - FEV1/FVC ratio: 0.56

- **Chest X-ray (PA and lateral, done same day):** Hyperinflated lung fields. Flattened diaphragms. No focal consolidation, mass, or pleural effusion. Heart size normal. No pneumothorax. Consistent with COPD.

### Assessment
1. **COPD, GOLD Stage II (moderate)** — confirmed. FEV1 post-bronchodilator 65% predicted, FEV1/FVC 0.56. Compared to last PFTs (2022: FEV1 69% predicted), there has been a modest decline of approximately 4% over 2 years, which is within expected progression. GOLD Group B (symptomatic, low exacerbation risk) — mMRC dyspnea grade 1, 0 exacerbations in the past year.
2. **Air trapping and mild hyperinflation** — consistent with obstructive physiology. RV elevated at 138% predicted.
3. **Mildly reduced DLCO** — 68% predicted. No clinical concern for concurrent ILD. Likely reflects emphysematous changes. No indication for CT chest at this time.
4. **Smoking cessation** — sustained abstinence, commended.

### Plan
1. Continue current maintenance therapy: tiotropium bromide 2.5 mcg 2 puffs inhaled daily. No indication to escalate to LABA/LAMA combination or add ICS at this time (low exacerbation frequency, symptoms adequately controlled).
2. Continue salbutamol PRN for rescue.
3. Recommend pulmonary rehabilitation program — will refer to Health Sciences North Pulmonary Rehab Program in Sudbury for patient convenience, if available; otherwise, virtual pulmonary rehab through Ontario Telemedicine Network.
4. Reinforce daily physical activity — encourage progressive increase to 30 minutes of walking daily.
5. Annual influenza and pneumococcal vaccination — confirmed Pneu-P-23 given March 2024.
6. COPD Action Plan provided and reviewed with patient. Reviewed when to start prednisone burst and when to seek emergency care.
7. Repeat PFTs in 12 months to trend FEV1 decline.
8. Consultation report to Dr. Chakraborty via eConsult.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: Respirology follow-up in 12-14 months for repeat PFTs. Sooner if exacerbation or symptom escalation.
- Referrals: Pulmonary rehabilitation — Health Sciences North, Sudbury (referral faxed). Report sent to Dr. Chakraborty.

### Assessment
1. **COPD, moderate (GOLD Stage II, Group B)** — confirmed by respirology. FEV1 65% predicted, stable clinical picture. COPD Action Plan in place. Pulmonary rehabilitation pending start.
2. **Cardiovascular risk** — Framingham Risk Score calculated: ~14% (moderate 10-year risk). LDL 2.9 mmol/L — borderline. Given COPD and moderate CV risk, lifestyle modification is primary intervention. Statin not yet indicated per Canadian guidelines unless FRS >= 20% or additional risk factors emerge.
3. **Renal function** — eGFR 78, stable. Mild age-related decline. No proteinuria screening needed at this time unless diabetes develops.
4. **FIT for colorectal cancer screening** — patient has not yet completed. Reminded.

### Plan
1. Continue tiotropium 2.5 mcg 2 puffs daily and salbutamol PRN — no medication changes.
2. Reinforce COPD Action Plan — patient demonstrates understanding of yellow zone (increased dyspnea, sputum volume/colour change) and red zone (severe dyspnea, SpO2 < 90%, inability to speak in sentences).
3. Encourage pulmonary rehab participation once start date confirmed.

## Encounter 4: 2024-10-18 — COPD Exacerbation: Acute Visit

- Date: 2024-10-18
- Time: 14:45
- Type: Walk-in
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Sudbury-Manitoulin Family Health Team (865 Regent St, Suite 210, Sudbury, ON)
- Practitioner: Dr. Anita Chakraborty, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-68390)
- Reason for visit: Acute worsening of COPD symptoms — increased dyspnea and productive cough x 4 days

### Subjective
Mohammed presents as a same-day urgent visit. He reports that 4 days ago he developed an upper respiratory tract infection with rhinorrhea, sore throat, and mild malaise. Over the past 2 days, his dyspnea has worsened significantly — he now becomes short of breath walking from his bedroom to the kitchen (approximately 15 metres). His cough has increased in frequency and is now productive of moderate volumes of yellow-green sputum, which is a change from his usual white/clear sputum. He has been using his salbutamol inhaler 6-8 times daily with only partial relief. He denies fever (has not measured temperature at home). He reports mild bilateral chest tightness but no pleuritic chest pain. No hemoptysis. He slept poorly for the past two nights due to cough and dyspnea, requiring two pillows (new for him). Appetite is reduced. He denies leg swelling, palpitations, or syncope. He has not started his COPD Action Plan medications as he was uncertain whether his symptoms met the threshold. He attended 4 sessions of pulmonary rehab before this illness interrupted his participation.

### Objective
- **Vitals:** BP 142/84 mmHg, HR 92 bpm, RR 22, Temp 37.8 C, SpO2 91% on RA (baseline 95%), Weight 77.0 kg.
- **General:** Mildly distressed, sitting upright and leaning forward. Using accessory muscles (sternocleidomastoid). Speaking in short sentences (4-5 words between breaths).
- **Respiratory:** Increased AP diameter. Diffuse bilateral expiratory and inspiratory wheeze. Scattered rhonchi bilaterally, more prominent on the right. Coarse crackles at right base. Prolonged expiratory phase. Reduced air entry at both bases.
- **Cardiovascular:** Tachycardic, regular rhythm. S1 S2 normal. No S3. No peripheral edema. JVP not elevated.
- **ENT:** Mild pharyngeal erythema, no exudate. Nasal mucosa erythematous.
- **Extremities:** No cyanosis, no clubbing. Cap refill < 3 seconds.

### Assessment
1. **Acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD), moderate severity** — Anthonisen Type I exacerbation (increased dyspnea + increased sputum volume + increased sputum purulence). Likely triggered by viral upper respiratory tract infection with secondary bacterial component (purulent sputum). SpO2 significantly below baseline at 91%. Increased work of breathing with accessory muscle use. No signs of respiratory failure or need for hospitalization at this time, but close monitoring required.
2. **Viral upper respiratory tract infection** — likely precipitant. Consider influenza given timing (October); however, no influenza vaccine received yet this season.

### Plan
1. **Prednisone 40 mg PO daily x 5 days** — start today. Prescription provided. (As per GOLD guidelines and COPD Action Plan.)
2. **Amoxicillin 500 mg PO TID x 7 days** — initiated given Anthonisen Type I exacerbation with purulent sputum. (Alternative: doxycycline if no improvement in 48-72 hours.)
3. **Increase salbutamol** — 4-6 puffs via spacer q4h standing for 48-72 hours, then taper to PRN as symptoms improve.
4. **Continue tiotropium** — no change to maintenance therapy.
5. SpO2 monitoring at home — portable pulse oximeter provided on loan from FHT. Instructed to present to ED if SpO2 < 88% or worsening dyspnea unresponsive to salbutamol.
6. Push oral fluids, rest. Avoid cold air exposure.
7. Influenza vaccine deferred until resolution of acute illness — plan to administer at follow-up.
8. If no improvement in 48 hours or worsening, present to Health Sciences North ED.
9. Sputum culture not obtained (empiric treatment initiated, outpatient setting).

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 10-14 days (early November) for reassessment. Sooner or to ED if clinical deterioration.
- Referrals: None.

## Encounter 5: 2024-11-05 — FP Follow-Up Post-Exacerbation

- Date: 2024-11-05
- Time: 11:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Sudbury-Manitoulin Family Health Team (865 Regent St, Suite 210, Sudbury, ON)
- Practitioner: Dr. Anita Chakraborty, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-68390)
- Reason for visit: Post-exacerbation follow-up — COPD

### Subjective
Mohammed reports significant improvement since starting prednisone and amoxicillin. He completed both courses as prescribed. His dyspnea returned to near-baseline by day 7 of treatment. His cough has decreased substantially — now back to his usual small-volume white sputum in the mornings. He has reduced salbutamol use to approximately 3 times per week, which is close to his pre-exacerbation baseline. He reports his energy level is still slightly lower than before the exacerbation. He resumed his daily walks 3 days ago, currently managing 15 minutes. Sleep has improved — back to lying flat without additional pillows. No recurrence of purulent sputum, fever, or chest tightness. He used the pulse oximeter at home and his readings were consistently 93-95% after the first week. He has not yet resumed pulmonary rehab.

### Objective
- **Vitals:** BP 130/76 mmHg, HR 74 bpm, RR 16, Temp 36.4 C, SpO2 94% on RA, Weight 76.2 kg (down 0.8 kg from exacerbation visit).
- **General:** Well-appearing, no distress, no accessory muscle use. Speaking in full sentences comfortably.
- **Respiratory:** Bilateral mild expiratory wheeze at bases, consistent with previous baseline. No rhonchi. No crackles. Air entry improved compared to October 18 visit. Expiratory phase mildly prolonged.
- **Cardiovascular:** HR regular, S1 S2 normal, no edema.

### Assessment
1. **COPD exacerbation (October 2024) — resolved.** Patient has returned to near-baseline. SpO2 94% — slightly below his typical 95%, expected during recovery phase. This was his first exacerbation in over 12 months, triggered by a viral URI. Mild residual deconditioning noted.
2. **GOLD reassessment** — now GOLD Group E (previously B) given 1 moderate exacerbation in the past year. Per 2024 GOLD report, consider escalation to LABA/LAMA combination if recurrent exacerbations occur. Single exacerbation — maintain current therapy and reassess.
3. **Deconditioning** — post-exacerbation. Encourage resumption of pulmonary rehab and daily walking.
4. **Influenza vaccine** — deferred from October, now due.

### Plan
1. Continue tiotropium 2.5 mcg 2 puffs daily and salbutamol PRN — no escalation at this time given single exacerbation and good recovery. Will reconsider LABA/LAMA if second exacerbation occurs within 12 months.
2. **Influenza vaccine administered today** — quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Fluzone, left deltoid, Lot# FL9921, Exp 2025-06).
3. Resume pulmonary rehabilitation — patient to contact Health Sciences North to re-enroll. Emphasized importance given post-exacerbation deconditioning.
4. Gradually increase walking duration back to 20+ minutes daily.
5. Review COPD Action Plan: patient confirmed he now understands when to self-initiate prednisone and antibiotics. Plan updated with emergency prednisone 40 mg x 5 days and amoxicillin 500 mg TID x 7 days prescriptions (to keep at home for future exacerbation self-management).
6. Pulse oximeter returned to FHT.
7. Return in 2 months or PRN.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 2 months (January 2025) with NP Derek Lapointe for inhaler technique review and smoking cessation maintenance check.
- Referrals: Pulmonary rehab re-enrollment (patient to self-refer back).

- Reason for visit: Inhaler technique assessment, smoking cessation maintenance, COPD stable follow-up

### Subjective
Mohammed presents for a scheduled follow-up with the NP. He feels well overall and reports his breathing has returned fully to pre-exacerbation baseline. His morning cough is minimal with small amounts of white sputum. He is using salbutamol approximately 1-2 times per week, mostly prophylactically before walks on cold days. He resumed pulmonary rehabilitation in December and has attended 3 sessions so far — reports he finds the supervised exercise helpful and feels more confident managing his breathing during exertion. He continues daily walks, now up to 25 minutes. He denies any craving for tobacco or exposure to triggers. He has not had any further respiratory infections since October. No orthopnea, no leg swelling, no weight change. He completed his FIT test in November — result was negative (confirmed in chart). Mood remains stable.

### Objective
- **Vitals:** BP 126/74 mmHg, HR 70 bpm, RR 14, Temp 36.4 C, SpO2 95% on RA, Weight 76.4 kg.
- **General:** Well-appearing, comfortable, no distress.
- **Respiratory:** Mild bilateral expiratory wheeze at bases — baseline. No crackles, no rhonchi. Good air entry throughout.

- **Inhaler Technique Assessment:**
  - **Spiriva Respimat:** Patient demonstrates correct technique — slow deep inhalation, breath hold for 10 seconds, exhales away from device. Correct priming of device confirmed. No errors identified.
  - **Ventolin HFA with spacer:** Patient shakes canister, attaches to spacer, exhales fully, actuates canister and inhales slowly over 3-5 seconds, holds breath for 10 seconds. Technique is correct. Spacer is in good condition (AeroChamber Plus, < 1 year old).

- **Smoking Cessation Assessment:**
  - Tobacco-free since November 2018 (~6.2 years).
  - Fagerstrom score: 0 (no current nicotine dependence).
  - Denies use of e-cigarettes, cannabis, or other inhaled substances.
  - No significant triggers or cravings reported.

### Assessment
1. **COPD, moderate (GOLD Stage II)** — clinically stable. Baseline symptoms restored post-exacerbation. SpO2 at baseline of 95%. Salbutamol use low and appropriate.
2. **Inhaler technique** — correct for both Spiriva Respimat and Ventolin HFA with spacer. No intervention needed.
3. **Smoking cessation** — sustained abstinence, 6+ years. Excellent long-term quit. Risk of relapse is low but ongoing reinforcement is appropriate.
4. **Pulmonary rehabilitation** — re-enrolled and attending. Positive engagement.
5. **Colorectal cancer screening** — FIT negative (November 2024). Next due in 2 years.

### Plan
1. Continue current medications unchanged: tiotropium 2.5 mcg 2 puffs daily, salbutamol PRN.
2. Continue pulmonary rehabilitation program — target completion of full 8-week program.
3. Positive reinforcement for smoking cessation. Brief motivational counselling provided — acknowledged patient's sustained effort and health benefits achieved.
4. Encouraged continuation of daily walking. Discussed cold weather precautions: breathe through nose or wear a scarf/buff over mouth when walking in extreme cold to reduce cold-air-triggered bronchospasm; use salbutamol 15 minutes before cold exposure.
5. COPD Action Plan reviewed — standby prescriptions confirmed in chart (prednisone + amoxicillin).
6. Next annual physical with Dr. Chakraborty in approximately April 2025.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: Annual physical with Dr. Chakraborty in April 2025. NP visit PRN or as directed.

3. **Smoking cessation** — sustained, 6.5 years.
4. **Preventive health** — influenza vaccine current. Pneu-P-23 given March 2024 (one-time for age 65+). FIT negative November 2024.
5. **Patient concern re: travel for respirology** — valid concern. Will coordinate with Dr. Torres regarding possibility of PFTs at Health Sciences North Sudbury with results sent to Hamilton for interpretation, or explore Ontario Telemedicine Network follow-up.

### Plan
1. Continue tiotropium 2.5 mcg 2 puffs daily and salbutamol PRN.
2. Contact Dr. Torres' office regarding repeat PFTs — request PFTs be performed at Health Sciences North (Sudbury) pulmonary function lab with results forwarded to Dr. Torres for interpretation and virtual follow-up. If not feasible, schedule in-person in Hamilton for July 2025.
3. Encourage maintenance of exercise gains from pulmonary rehab — daily 30-minute walks.
4. Review lab results when available; phone call if significant.
5. Influenza vaccine to be given October 2025.

Exertional dyspnea is mild — maintained with 30 minutes of daily walking. Occasional use of salbutamol (once weekly). Morning cough is minimal. He had one exacerbation in October 2024, treated with prednisone and amoxicillin, with full recovery. No exacerbations since. He completed 7 of 8 pulmonary rehab sessions and has maintained his exercise routine. Tobacco-free. No new symptoms. He asks about his PFT results and whether his COPD is getting worse.

### Objective
(Vitals obtained at PFT appointment, July 10, 2025)
- **Vitals:** BP 130/76 mmHg, HR 74 bpm, RR 15, SpO2 95% on RA, Weight 76.8 kg.
- **General (via video):** Well-appearing, comfortable, speaking in full sentences without dyspnea.
- **Respiratory (via video):** No audible wheeze. No visible accessory muscle use. Breathing comfortably at rest.

- **Pulmonary Function Tests (July 10, 2025, Health Sciences North):**
  - **Pre-bronchodilator:**
    - FVC: 3.38 L (81% predicted)
    - FEV1: 1.83 L (60% predicted)
    - FEV1/FVC ratio: 0.54
    - TLC: 7.22 L (114% predicted)
    - DLCO: 65% predicted
    - RV: 3.84 L (142% predicted)
  - **Post-bronchodilator (salbutamol 400 mcg):**
    - FEV1: 1.91 L (63% predicted) — change of 80 mL (4.4%), not significant
    - FEV1/FVC: 0.55

  - **Comparison to May 2024 PFTs:**
    - FEV1 (post-BD): 65% -> 63% predicted (decline of ~2% over 14 months)
    - FVC: 82% -> 81% predicted
    - DLCO: 68% -> 65% predicted
    - RV: 138% -> 142% predicted (mild increase in air trapping)

### Assessment
1. **COPD, GOLD Stage II (moderate)** — FEV1 post-bronchodilator 63% predicted. Compared to May 2024 (65%), the decline is approximately 2% over 14 months, which is consistent with expected COPD progression (~30-50 mL/year FEV1 decline in moderate COPD). Patient remains in Stage II (FEV1 50-79%). DLCO mildly reduced and slightly declined — consistent with progressive emphysematous change.
2. **GOLD Group E** — 1 moderate exacerbation in the past 12 months (October 2024). If exacerbation-free over the next 3 months, will revert to Group B reassessment.
3. **Air trapping** — mildly progressive (RV 138% -> 142%). Consistent with disease trajectory.
4. **Functional status** — improved relative to last respirology visit, attributable to pulmonary rehabilitation and maintained exercise. mMRC grade 1.

### Plan
1. **Continue current therapy** — tiotropium 2.5 mcg 2 puffs daily and salbutamol PRN. Given only one exacerbation in the past year and symptoms well-controlled, no escalation to LABA/LAMA combination at this time. If a second exacerbation occurs within 12 months, recommend escalation to umeclidinium/vilanterol (Anoro Ellipta) or tiotropium/olodaterol (Stiolto Respimat).
2. **COPD Action Plan** — confirmed in place. Standby prescriptions for prednisone and amoxicillin confirmed.
3. Encourage ongoing daily exercise — minimum 30 minutes walking. Consider community-based maintenance exercise programs.
4. **Annual influenza vaccine** — due October 2025.
5. **Repeat PFTs in 12 months** (July 2026) — same arrangement (PFTs at HSN Sudbury, virtual follow-up). If FEV1 declines to < 50% predicted (Stage III/severe), will reassess therapy and consider oxygen assessment.
6. Counsel patient that current rate of decline is within expected range. Sustained smoking cessation is the single most important factor in slowing FEV1 decline — reinforced.
7. Report to Dr. Chakraborty sent via eConsult.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: Respirology in 12 months (July 2026) or sooner if exacerbation or functional decline. Virtual follow-up via OTN.
- Referrals: Report to Dr. Chakraborty.

## Encounter 9: 2025-11-22 — COPD Exacerbation: Urgent Walk-In Visit

- Date: 2025-11-22
- Time: 16:20
- Type: Walk-in
- Setting: Family Health Team (urgent same-day)
- Organization: Sudbury-Manitoulin Family Health Team (865 Regent St, Suite 210, Sudbury, ON)
- Practitioner: NP Derek Lapointe, MN NP-PHC (ON-NP-51087)
- Reason for visit: Acute worsening of COPD — increased dyspnea and cough x 3 days

### Subjective
Mohammed presents to the FHT urgent walk-in clinic (Dr. Chakraborty unavailable today; seen by NP Lapointe). He reports onset of increased cough and dyspnea beginning 3 days ago. He initially attributed it to the cold weather but over the past 24 hours his symptoms have worsened noticeably. He is now dyspneic walking short distances indoors (e.g., to the bathroom). Cough is frequent and productive of moderate volumes of yellow sputum — a change from his baseline white sputum. He has been using his salbutamol 8-10 times daily with diminishing relief. He denies frank purulence (no green sputum) but notes the sputum is thicker than usual. He had mild rhinorrhea and sneezing starting 5 days ago, which preceded the chest symptoms. He denies fever (measured 37.2 C at home this morning), rigors, or night sweats. No hemoptysis. He slept propped up on two pillows last night. Appetite is poor. He considered starting his standby medications (prednisone and amoxicillin) but wanted to be assessed first. He received his influenza vaccine 4 weeks ago (October 2025) and his COVID-19 booster in September 2025.

### Objective
- **Vitals:** BP 138/82 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, RR 20, Temp 37.4 C, SpO2 90% on RA (baseline 95%), Weight 76.6 kg.
- **General:** Mildly dyspneic at rest, sitting upright. Mild accessory muscle use (SCM). Speaking in 6-8 word sentences.
- **Respiratory:** Diffuse bilateral expiratory and inspiratory wheeze. Scattered rhonchi throughout, more prominent on the left. No crackles. Air entry reduced bilaterally, more so at the bases. Prolonged expiratory phase.
- **Cardiovascular:** Tachycardic, regular rhythm, S1 S2 normal. No peripheral edema. JVP not elevated.
- **ENT:** Mild nasal congestion, clear rhinorrhea. Oropharynx mildly erythematous.
- **Extremities:** No cyanosis. Peripherally warm.

### Assessment
1. **Acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD), moderate severity** — Anthonisen Type II exacerbation (increased dyspnea + change in sputum character; sputum volume increased). Likely precipitated by viral upper respiratory tract infection. SpO2 90% — 5% below baseline, concerning and at the threshold for emergency department referral. However, patient is alert, able to speak in sentences, and hemodynamically stable. Will treat and reassess in clinic before deciding on disposition.
2. **Second exacerbation within 13 months** — this represents a pattern of fall/winter exacerbations (October 2024, November 2025). Two exacerbations in 13 months meets the threshold for consideration of therapy escalation per GOLD guidelines.

### Plan
1. **In-clinic treatment (observed):**
   - Salbutamol 4 puffs via spacer administered in clinic — reassessed after 20 minutes.
   - Post-salbutamol: SpO2 improved to 92%, RR 18, patient reports mild improvement in dyspnea. Wheeze still present but less intense.
2. **Prednisone 40 mg PO daily x 5 days** — patient to start standby prescription today. Confirmed supply at home.
3. **Amoxicillin 500 mg PO TID x 7 days** — initiated given sputum colour change. Patient to start standby prescription today. If sputum becomes green/frankly purulent or no improvement in 48-72 hours, switch to amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg BID or doxycycline 100 mg BID.
4. **Salbutamol 4-6 puffs via spacer q4h standing** for 72 hours, then taper to PRN.
5. **Continue tiotropium** unchanged.
6. Pulse oximeter loaned from FHT — monitor SpO2 at rest and with exertion. **Present to Health Sciences North ED if SpO2 < 88% at rest, worsening dyspnea despite salbutamol, inability to speak in sentences, confusion, or chest pain.**
7. NP to communicate with Dr. Chakraborty regarding encounter and plan.
8. Phone follow-up in 48 hours by NP Lapointe.
9. In-person follow-up once exacerbation resolved — discuss therapy escalation to LABA/LAMA combination.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: Phone in 48 hours. In-person with Dr. Chakraborty in 2-3 months (February 2026) for COPD review and medication reassessment. To ED if clinical deterioration.
- Referrals: None. Dr. Chakraborty notified.

## Encounter 10: 2026-02-10 — FP Follow-Up: Recovery and Action Plan Review

- Date: 2026-02-10
- Time: 10:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Sudbury-Manitoulin Family Health Team (865 Regent St, Suite 210, Sudbury, ON)
- Practitioner: Dr. Anita Chakraborty, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-68390)
- Reason for visit: Post-exacerbation follow-up, COPD therapy reassessment, action plan review

### Subjective
Mohammed reports the November exacerbation resolved over approximately 10 days. He completed the prednisone and amoxicillin courses as directed. NP Lapointe's 48-hour phone follow-up confirmed improving symptoms and SpO2 of 93%. He gradually returned to baseline over the following week. His dyspnea is now back to his usual level — mild with moderate exertion. He is walking 20-25 minutes daily (slightly reduced from his peak of 30 minutes; he attributes this to the cold weather and lingering caution). Cough is at baseline — small amounts of white sputum in the mornings. Salbutamol use is back to 1-2 times per week. He has not had any further respiratory infections since November. Sleep is normal. Appetite is good. Weight is stable. He is aware that Dr. Chakraborty wanted to discuss changing his inhaler given the two exacerbations, and he is open to this. He denies tobacco use or cravings. Mood is stable though he expresses some frustration about having two "bad spells" in the fall/winter — he asks if there is more he can do to prevent them.

### Objective
- **Vitals:** BP 130/76 mmHg, HR 72 bpm, RR 15, Temp 36.5 C, SpO2 95% on RA, Weight 76.5 kg.
- **General:** Well-appearing, comfortable, no distress. Speaking in full sentences.
- **Respiratory:** Mild bilateral expiratory wheeze at bases — consistent with established baseline. No rhonchi, no crackles. Air entry adequate. No prolonged expiratory phase at rest.
- **Cardiovascular:** S1 S2 normal, regular rate and rhythm. No peripheral edema.
- **April 2025 Lab Results (reviewed):**
  - CBC: Hb 146 g/L, WBC 7.1 x10^9/L, Plt 228 x10^9/L — normal.
  - Fasting glucose: 5.5 mmol/L — normal.
  - HbA1c: 5.7% — normal.
  - Lipid panel: TC 4.9, LDL 2.7, HDL 1.4, TG 1.6 mmol/L — improved from 2024 (lifestyle modification effect).
  - Creatinine: 90 umol/L, eGFR: 76 mL/min/1.73m2 — stable (mild age-related CKD stage 2).

### Assessment
1. **COPD, moderate (GOLD Stage II), GOLD Group E** — two moderate exacerbations in 13 months (October 2024 and November 2025), both occurring in the fall/winter season, both triggered by viral URIs. Current FEV1 (July 2025) 63% predicted. Patient has returned to baseline between exacerbations with no evidence of accelerated decline. However, the exacerbation frequency now meets the threshold for therapy escalation per GOLD 2025 guidelines.
2. **Seasonal exacerbation pattern** — both exacerbations occurred October-November, coinciding with respiratory virus season and cold weather exposure. This pattern is common in COPD patients in Northern Ontario.
3. **Therapy escalation indicated** — given 2 exacerbations in 13 months, guidelines recommend stepping up from LAMA monotherapy to LABA/LAMA combination. Blood eosinophils were not recently measured — should be checked to determine whether ICS addition is warranted (ICS benefit if eosinophils >= 300 cells/uL).
4. **Lipid profile** — improved with dietary modification. LDL 2.7, within acceptable range for moderate cardiovascular risk. Continue lifestyle measures.
5. **Renal function** — eGFR 76, stable.

### Plan
1. **Escalate inhaler therapy:**
   - **Discontinue** tiotropium bromide (Spiriva Respimat) monotherapy.
   - **Initiate** umeclidinium 62.5 mcg / vilanterol 25 mcg (Anoro Ellipta) — 1 inhalation once daily. This LABA/LAMA combination provides dual bronchodilation and has demonstrated reduction in exacerbation frequency compared to LAMA alone. Prescription provided. Inhaler technique teaching done in clinic: open cover, exhale away from device, place mouthpiece in mouth, inhale deeply and steadily, hold breath for 10 seconds, exhale. Patient demonstrated correct technique on first attempt.
   - **Continue** salbutamol PRN for rescue.
2. **Order bloodwork:** CBC with differential (to obtain eosinophil count) — if eosinophils >= 300 cells/uL, consider adding ICS (e.g., escalate to fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol [Trelegy Ellipta]). If eosinophils < 300, remain on LABA/LAMA without ICS.
3. **Update COPD Action Plan** — revised to reflect new maintenance inhaler (Anoro Ellipta). Standby prescriptions for prednisone 40 mg x 5 days and amoxicillin 500 mg TID x 7 days renewed. New action plan printed and provided.
4. **Seasonal prevention strategies discussed:**
   - Ensure annual influenza vaccine each October.
   - COVID-19 booster as per NACI guidance.
   - Avoid crowded indoor spaces during peak respiratory virus season (November-March) when possible.
   - Hand hygiene reinforcement.
   - Pre-treat with salbutamol before cold air exposure; use scarf/buff over mouth.
   - Discussed pneumococcal vaccine — Pneu-P-23 given March 2024 (single dose for age >= 65, per Ontario guidelines; no booster currently indicated).
5. **Encourage return to 30-minute daily walks** as weather permits. Consider indoor walking (shopping mall, community centre) during extreme cold.
6. **Pulmonary rehabilitation maintenance** — patient completed program in 2024/2025. Discussed self-directed maintenance exercises. HSN Sudbury offers a community maintenance group — information provided.
7. **Respirology follow-up** — PFTs due July 2026 per Dr. Torres' recommendation. Will coordinate same arrangement (PFTs at HSN Sudbury, virtual OTN follow-up). Copy of today's note to be sent to Dr. Torres.
8. **Follow-up with NP Lapointe** in 4-6 weeks to reassess response to Anoro Ellipta and review eosinophil results.
9. Next annual physical April 2026.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: NP visit in 4-6 weeks (March 2026) for new inhaler response assessment. Annual physical April 2026. Respirology July 2026.
- Referrals: Note sent to Dr. Torres re: therapy escalation. No new specialist referrals.
