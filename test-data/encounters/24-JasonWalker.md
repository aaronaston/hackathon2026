- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Kitchener-Waterloo Family Health Team, 200 King St W, Suite 400, Kitchener, ON
- Practitioner: Dr. Robert Osei, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-65189)
- Reason for visit: Chest discomfort — patient concerned about heart

### Subjective
Mr. Walker presents as a walk-in, reporting intermittent left-sided chest discomfort for the past 3 days. Describes it as a "tightness" or "ache" localized to the left anterior chest wall, non-radiating. The discomfort is not clearly related to exertion — he has continued his daily walks without worsening symptoms. It is intermittent, lasting minutes at a time, and he notices it more when sitting and thinking about it. No associated dyspnea, diaphoresis, nausea, palpitations, or lightheadedness. No recent illness, heavy lifting, or chest trauma. He is visibly anxious and states his neighbour recently had a heart attack, which has "made me very worried." He has been checking his pulse frequently. He took an extra ASA yesterday "just in case" but otherwise medications are unchanged. Sleep has been disturbed for several nights due to worry.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 136/84 mmHg, HR 68 bpm (regular), RR 16, SpO2 99% RA, Temp 36.5C
- Weight: 78.5 kg
- General: Mildly anxious, NAD
- CV: S1/S2 normal, regular rhythm, no murmurs/gallops/rubs, JVP not elevated
- Resp: Clear bilaterally
- Chest wall: Tenderness to palpation over left 4th-5th costochondral junctions, reproducing his described discomfort; no swelling or erythema
- ECG (in-office): Normal sinus rhythm, rate 66 bpm, no acute ST-T changes, no new Q waves; unchanged from prior ECGs on file
- Troponin: Point-of-care troponin ordered; result pending (same-day lab draw sent to Grand River Hospital lab)

### Assessment
1. Chest discomfort — clinical presentation most consistent with costochondral/musculoskeletal chest wall pain; reproducible on palpation, not exertional, no ECG changes
2. Health anxiety in the context of neighbour's cardiac event and personal history of CAD — contributing to symptom amplification
3. Low probability of acute coronary syndrome: negative stress test 5 months ago, non-exertional symptoms, reproducible chest wall tenderness, normal ECG
4. CAD, stable — secondary prevention regimen intact

### Plan
1. Troponin sent to Grand River Hospital lab — will follow up result; call patient if abnormal
2. Reassurance provided: discussed clinical features suggesting musculoskeletal origin; reviewed negative stress test from June 2024
3. Trial of acetaminophen 500 mg PO q6h PRN for chest wall pain; avoid NSAIDs given CAD/ASA
4. Advised not to take extra ASA — reinforced correct dosing of 81 mg daily
5. Continue all regular medications unchanged
6. Discussed anxiety management: deep breathing exercises, limiting repetitive pulse-checking; offered referral to social worker at FHT for brief counselling if anxiety persists
7. Return in 2-4 weeks for reassessment, or to ED if worsening chest pain, dyspnea, diaphoresis, or pain with exertion

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 2-4 weeks (December); sooner or to Grand River Hospital ED if symptoms worsen
- Referrals: Pending — FHT social worker if anxiety persists

- Practitioner: Dr. Robert Osei, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-65189)
- Reason for visit: Lipid monitoring, medication renewal, and review of cardiology follow-up

### Subjective
Mr. Walker presents for a routine follow-up. He reports no new symptoms. No chest pain, dyspnea, or palpitations. He saw Dr. Hussain in June and was told everything was stable and his heart was doing well. He has maintained his exercise routine and healthy eating. He noticed his resting pulse seems lower lately — sometimes in the mid-50s — but he feels fine and has no dizziness or fatigue. No muscle aches or weakness (statin tolerance inquiry). No new medications or supplements. He would like to discuss whether he still needs all three medications long-term.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 120/72 mmHg, HR 56 bpm (regular), SpO2 98% RA
- Weight: 76.5 kg
- General: Well, NAD
- CV: Normal S1/S2, regular rhythm, no murmurs
- Review of Dr. Hussain's consultation report (2025-06-17): Stable CAD, negative stress test 2024, no repeat testing needed, continue current medications, sinus bradycardia on bisoprolol — asymptomatic
- Labs (fasting, drawn 2025-09-09):
  - LDL: 1.5 mmol/L
  - Total cholesterol: 3.6 mmol/L

3. Pre-diabetes — HbA1c 5.4%, now within normal range; lifestyle measures have been highly effective
4. Sinus bradycardia (HR 56) — asymptomatic; consistent with bisoprolol effect and improved cardiovascular fitness; Dr. Hussain concurs no change needed
5. Patient inquiry re: long-term medication need — discussed

### Plan
1. Continue all medications: ASA 81 mg daily, rosuvastatin 20 mg at bedtime, bisoprolol 5 mg daily
2. Discussed medication rationale with patient: ASA and rosuvastatin are lifelong for secondary prevention post-PCI; bisoprolol provides HR control and has mortality benefit in CAD; all three are well-tolerated and should be continued indefinitely barring side effects
3. Renew prescriptions: ASA 81 mg x 1 year; rosuvastatin 20 mg x 1 year; bisoprolol 5 mg x 1 year
4. HbA1c no longer in pre-diabetic range — continue lifestyle management; will monitor annually

## Encounter 9: 2025-12-03 — Walk-in for Musculoskeletal Chest Wall Pain

- Date: 2025-12-03
- Time: 15:20
- Type: Walk-in
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Kitchener-Waterloo Family Health Team, 200 King St W, Suite 400, Kitchener, ON
- Practitioner: Dr. Robert Osei, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-65189)
- Reason for visit: Left-sided chest pain after lifting heavy wood

### Subjective
Mr. Walker presents as a walk-in with left-sided chest pain that began yesterday afternoon. He was lifting heavy pieces of hardwood for a shelving project in his workshop and felt a sudden sharp pain in his left chest/rib area while carrying a large plank. The pain has persisted since, worse with deep breathing, twisting, and reaching overhead. It is sharp and well-localized. No central chest heaviness or pressure. No dyspnea at rest. He attempted his morning walk today but the pain worsened with arm swing, so he turned back. No associated diaphoresis, nausea, palpitations, or lightheadedness. He took acetaminophen 1000 mg this morning with partial relief. He notes this feels different from his November 2024 episode — more sharp and clearly related to the lifting. However, given his history, he wants to be checked. He is less anxious than during the prior episode.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 128/78 mmHg, HR 62 bpm (regular), RR 16, SpO2 98% RA
- Weight: 77.0 kg
- General: Mildly uncomfortable with movement, guarding left chest
- CV: Normal S1/S2, regular rhythm, no murmurs, JVP not elevated
- Resp: Clear bilaterally; pain with deep inspiration on the left side
- Chest wall: Point tenderness over left 6th-7th ribs laterally, with tenderness of the left serratus anterior muscle; pain reproduced with resisted arm adduction and with palpation; no crepitus, no swelling, no ecchymosis
- ECG (in-office): Normal sinus rhythm, rate 60 bpm, no ST-T changes, no acute ischemic changes; unchanged from prior
- Rib X-ray not performed — clinical presentation strongly suggests muscular strain; no suspicion of fracture (no point tenderness directly over rib, no crepitus)

### Assessment
1. Musculoskeletal chest wall pain — left serratus anterior strain and left lateral rib area tenderness, clearly related to heavy lifting; clinical presentation inconsistent with cardiac etiology
2. No features of acute coronary syndrome: pain is pleuritic/positional/reproducible, non-exertional onset (lifting-related), ECG unchanged, hemodynamically stable
3. CAD, stable — no change in cardiac status; well-managed

### Plan
1. Acetaminophen 500 mg PO q6h regularly for 5-7 days, then PRN; avoid NSAIDs (ASA interaction, CAD)
2. Ice packs to affected area 15-20 min several times daily for first 48 hours, then transition to heat
3. Relative rest from heavy lifting for 2-3 weeks; may continue walking at a gentle pace as tolerated
4. Continue all cardiac medications unchanged: ASA 81 mg daily, rosuvastatin 20 mg at bedtime, bisoprolol 5 mg daily
5. Reassurance provided: discussed musculoskeletal mechanism and differentiation from cardiac pain; patient appropriately presented for evaluation given his history
6. Return if pain worsens, develops new character (pressure, radiation), or is accompanied by dyspnea/diaphoresis — go to Grand River Hospital ED in that case

### Disposition
- Follow-up: As needed; annual physical scheduled February 2026

### Subjective
Mr. Walker presents for his annual CAD review and physical examination. He is feeling well. The left-sided chest wall pain from the December lifting injury resolved after approximately 10 days with acetaminophen and rest. He has returned to his full exercise routine — walking 45 minutes daily, light resistance training twice weekly. He has resumed his woodworking but is being more careful with heavy lifting. No cardiac symptoms: no chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, or exercise intolerance. Medications continued without interruption. No side effects. No new health concerns. He asks about when his next cardiology appointment will be. Diet and lifestyle remain stable. He received his COVID-19 booster in November 2025 at the pharmacy.
