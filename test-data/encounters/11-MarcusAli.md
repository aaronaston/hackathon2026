## Encounter 1: 2024-04-16 — Annual Physical / Lipid Review

- Date: 2024-04-16
- Time: 09:15
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton)
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Annual health examination and dyslipidemia management review

### Subjective
Mr. Ali presents for his annual physical examination and review of his dyslipidemia. He was diagnosed with mild dyslipidemia approximately two years ago after a routine lipid panel revealed an elevated LDL-C of 4.1 mmol/L. He was started on Rosuvastatin 10 mg nightly at that time and reports good adherence to the medication. He has no complaints today and feels generally well. He denies any muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness — specifically asked about myalgias given statin therapy. No changes in urine colour. No new gastrointestinal symptoms, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits. No chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea on exertion, or exercise intolerance.

He is a former smoker — quit approximately 4 years ago (smoked 0.5 pack per day for approximately 10 years, from age 22 to 32). He does not use nicotine replacement therapy and denies cravings. He drinks alcohol socially (2–3 beers per weekend). He works as a mechanical engineer and drives from Oshawa to Hamilton for work 3–4 days per week. He reports moderate physical activity — plays recreational basketball once weekly and walks the dog daily. Diet is mixed; he acknowledges a tendency toward high-sodium convenience foods on busy work days but cooks at home on weekends.

No known allergies. No prior surgeries. No other medications or supplements.

Family history: Father with hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Mother healthy. No family history of premature coronary artery disease (MI or stroke before age 55 in first-degree male relatives or before age 65 in first-degree female relatives).

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 124/78 mmHg, HR 68 bpm, RR 14, Temp 36.5°C, SpO2 99% RA
- Height: 180 cm, Weight: 86.0 kg, BMI: 26.5 kg/m²
- General: Well-appearing male, no acute distress
- HEENT: Pupils equal and reactive, oropharynx clear, no thyromegaly, no xanthelasma, no corneal arcus
- Cardiovascular: S1 S2 normal, no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Peripheral pulses 2+ bilaterally (radial, dorsalis pedis)
- Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly
- Extremities: No peripheral edema
- Skin: No xanthomas

Lab results (drawn 2024-04-09):
- Total cholesterol: 4.3 mmol/L
- LDL-C: 2.5 mmol/L (previous 4.1 mmol/L at diagnosis, pre-statin)
- HDL-C: 1.3 mmol/L
- Triglycerides: 1.1 mmol/L
- Non-HDL cholesterol: 3.0 mmol/L
- Fasting glucose: 5.1 mmol/L
- HbA1c: 5.3%
- Creatinine: 88 µmol/L, eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73m²
- ALT: 28 U/L (normal; monitored given statin therapy)
- CK: 145 U/L (normal range 30–200 U/L; baseline for statin myopathy monitoring)
- TSH: 1.8 mIU/L
- CBC: within normal limits

Cardiovascular risk assessment:
- Modified Framingham Risk Score calculated: 10-year risk 7.8% (low risk, < 10%). Risk factors considered: age 36, male sex, total cholesterol 4.3, HDL 1.3, BP 124/78 (untreated), non-diabetic, former smoker.

### Assessment
1. Dyslipidemia — well controlled on Rosuvastatin 10 mg nightly. LDL-C has decreased from 4.1 mmol/L to 2.5 mmol/L, representing a 39% reduction. Per Canadian Cardiovascular Society 2021 guidelines, target LDL-C for primary prevention in a low-to-intermediate risk individual is ≥ 50% reduction or < 2.0 mmol/L. While the absolute value is improved, he has not yet achieved the 50% reduction target. However, given his low Framingham risk score and no evidence of atherosclerotic disease, current control is acceptable. Will reassess at next follow-up and consider dose adjustment if LDL-C does not continue to trend downward with lifestyle changes.
2. Former smoker — quit 4 years ago, no cravings, no NRT use. Commended on sustained cessation. Cardiovascular risk reduction from smoking cessation continues to accrue over time; risk approaches that of a non-smoker at approximately 10–15 years post-cessation.
3. Overweight — BMI 26.5 (overweight range). Weight is stable. Discussed benefit of dietary optimization for lipid management.
4. Health maintenance — Tetanus booster up to date (2021). No other immunizations due. No colorectal cancer screening indicated until age 50.

### Plan
1. Continue Rosuvastatin 10 mg PO nightly.
2. Dietary counselling — discussed Mediterranean-style dietary pattern for cardiovascular risk reduction. Encouraged reduction in processed foods and sodium intake, increased intake of vegetables, legumes, whole grains, fish, and olive oil. Provided the FHT's printed dietary resource sheet for heart-healthy eating.
3. Continue physical activity — encouraged increase to 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per CCS guidelines. Basketball and walking are good foundation; suggested adding 1–2 additional sessions per week.
4. Statin tolerability monitoring — no myalgias at present. CK and ALT within normal limits. Advised to report any new-onset muscle pain, weakness, or dark urine promptly.
5. Repeat fasting lipid panel in 6 months (October 2024) to reassess LDL-C trajectory. Requisition provided.
6. Smoking cessation maintenance — reinforced benefits of remaining smoke-free. Discussed that cardiovascular risk will continue to decrease over the coming years.
7. No referrals indicated at this time.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 6 months for lipid panel follow-up
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 2: 2024-10-22 — Lipid Follow-up Labs

- Date: 2024-10-22
- Time: 14:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton)
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Six-month follow-up for dyslipidemia management and repeat fasting lipid panel review

### Subjective
Mr. Ali returns for his planned 6-month lipid follow-up. He reports good adherence to Rosuvastatin 10 mg nightly — has missed only 2–3 doses over the past 6 months. He denies any muscle pain, tenderness, cramping, or weakness. No fatigue beyond his usual baseline. No change in urine colour. No gastrointestinal symptoms. No chest pain, dyspnea, or palpitations.

He has made some dietary changes since his last visit — cooking at home more frequently during the week and incorporating more fish (salmon and canned tuna) and vegetables. He has reduced his consumption of fast food to approximately once per week, down from 2–3 times per week. He continues to play recreational basketball weekly and walks daily. He has added a 30-minute cycling session on a stationary bike twice per week. He estimates his total weekly exercise is now approximately 180 minutes.

He remains a former smoker with no cravings. Alcohol intake unchanged (2–3 beers on weekends). No new medications, supplements, or allergies.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 122/76 mmHg, HR 66 bpm
- Weight: 85.2 kg, BMI: 26.3 kg/m² (down 0.8 kg from April)

Lab results (drawn 2024-10-15):
- Total cholesterol: 3.8 mmol/L (previous 4.3)
- LDL-C: 2.2 mmol/L (previous 2.5)
- HDL-C: 1.4 mmol/L (previous 1.3)
- Triglycerides: 1.0 mmol/L (previous 1.1)
- Non-HDL cholesterol: 2.4 mmol/L
- ALT: 24 U/L (normal)

### Assessment
1. Dyslipidemia — improving on Rosuvastatin 10 mg with lifestyle modifications. LDL-C decreased from 2.5 to 2.2 mmol/L. Compared to pre-treatment baseline of 4.1 mmol/L, this now represents a 46% reduction — approaching the 50% target recommended by the CCS. HDL-C improved slightly to 1.4 mmol/L, likely reflecting dietary changes and increased physical activity. Triglycerides stable and normal. ALT normal, no hepatotoxicity. No statin myopathy symptoms; CK not rechecked today as patient is asymptomatic.
2. Lifestyle modifications — patient has made meaningful dietary and exercise changes. Weight trending down modestly.
3. Former smoker — maintained cessation. Approaching 5-year mark (anticipated mid-2025).
4. Overall cardiovascular risk — remains low. No indication for escalation of therapy at this time.

### Plan
1. Continue Rosuvastatin 10 mg PO nightly — no dose adjustment at this time. LDL-C trending toward target with current regimen plus lifestyle modifications.
2. Reinforce dietary changes — commended patient on progress. Encouraged continued adherence to heart-healthy dietary pattern.
3. Continue physical activity — currently meeting 150 minutes/week target. Excellent effort.
4. Repeat fasting lipid panel at next annual physical (anticipated April 2025). Requisition to be provided closer to that date.
5. Continue statin tolerability monitoring — report any new myalgias promptly.
6. Influenza vaccine offered — patient declines. COVID-19 booster discussed — patient to schedule at pharmacy.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: Annual physical in approximately 6 months (spring 2025)
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 3: 2025-02-06 — Walk-in for Acute Low Back Strain

- Date: 2025-02-06
- Time: 11:30
- Type: Walk-in
- Setting: Walk-in Clinic
- Organization: Hamilton Medical Walk-in Centre
- Practitioner: Dr. Liam Chen, MD (ON-PRAC-52198)
- Reason for visit: Acute low back pain × 3 days following heavy lifting

### Subjective
Mr. Ali presents to the walk-in clinic with a 3-day history of low back pain. He reports that the pain began after helping a friend move furniture last Saturday. He felt a sudden sharp pain in his lower back while lifting a heavy dresser with an awkward twisting motion. The pain was initially severe (8/10) but has improved somewhat to 5–6/10 with rest and over-the-counter ibuprofen (400 mg taken intermittently, approximately 2–3 doses per day). The pain is localized to the lumbar region, bilateral but worse on the left side. It is aggravated by bending forward, standing from a seated position, and prolonged sitting (which is problematic given his commute from Oshawa to Hamilton). It is relieved partially by lying flat with knees bent and by ice packs.

He denies radiation of pain to the legs. No numbness, tingling, or weakness in the lower extremities. No saddle anesthesia, no bowel or bladder dysfunction (no urinary retention, incontinence, or fecal incontinence). No fever, weight loss, or night sweats. No history of cancer. No prior episodes of significant back pain. No recent trauma other than the lifting event described.

He is visiting the walk-in because his family physician, Dr. Moreau at Hamilton Mountain FHT, does not have available appointments this week.

Current medications: Rosuvastatin 10 mg nightly. No allergies. No other medical conditions apart from mild dyslipidemia.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 126/80 mmHg, HR 72 bpm, Temp 36.6°C
- General: Appears uncomfortable, moving cautiously, mild antalgic gait
- Lumbar spine inspection: No visible deformity, bruising, or swelling. Mild paraspinal muscle spasm palpable bilaterally, more prominent on the left
- Range of motion: Flexion limited to approximately 50% of normal due to pain. Extension limited. Lateral bending and rotation limited by discomfort. Pain localized to the lumbar paraspinal region with movement
- Palpation: Tenderness over L4-L5 paraspinal musculature bilaterally, left greater than right. No midline spinous process tenderness
- Neurological examination:
  - Straight leg raise: Negative bilaterally (no radicular symptoms with leg raise to 70 degrees)
  - Motor: Strength 5/5 in bilateral hip flexors, knee extensors, ankle dorsiflexors, great toe extensors, and ankle plantarflexors
  - Sensation: Intact to light touch in L2-S1 dermatomes bilaterally
  - Reflexes: Patellar 2+ bilaterally, Achilles 2+ bilaterally
- Perianal sensation: Intact (assessed given screening for cauda equina syndrome)

### Assessment
1. Acute mechanical low back strain — history consistent with musculoligamentous injury related to heavy lifting with twisting mechanism. No red flags for serious underlying pathology: no neurological deficits, negative straight leg raise, no signs of cauda equina syndrome, no features suggestive of malignancy, infection, or fracture. Canadian Chiropractic Guideline Initiative and CPA clinical pathway for acute non-specific low back pain supports conservative management.

### Plan
1. Conservative management with activity modification — avoid heavy lifting, bending, and twisting for the next 2 weeks. Gradual return to normal activities as tolerated. Avoid strict bed rest; continued gentle walking is encouraged.
2. Naproxen 500 mg PO BID with food × 7–10 days for anti-inflammatory effect — preferred over continued intermittent ibuprofen for more consistent coverage. Advised to take with food to reduce GI irritation. No contraindications identified (no history of GI ulceration, renal disease, or cardiovascular disease).
3. Acetaminophen 500 mg PO q6h PRN as adjunct for breakthrough pain.
4. Ice application to the affected area for 15–20 minutes every 2–3 hours during the first 48–72 hours of acute inflammation, transitioning to heat therapy after 72 hours for muscle relaxation.
5. Gentle stretching exercises reviewed — knee-to-chest stretch, pelvic tilt, and cat-cow stretch. Handout provided. Avoid exercises that increase pain.
6. No imaging indicated at this time — acute low back pain without red flags does not warrant plain radiographs or advanced imaging per Canadian evidence-based guidelines. Imaging should be considered if symptoms fail to improve after 4–6 weeks or if neurological deficits develop.
7. Advised to avoid recreational basketball until pain-free. Stationary cycling may be resumed once acute symptoms settle (likely 1–2 weeks).
8. Continue Rosuvastatin 10 mg nightly — no interaction with prescribed analgesics.
9. If symptoms worsen, new neurological symptoms develop (leg weakness, numbness, bowel/bladder changes), or pain is not improving after 2 weeks, advised to seek urgent reassessment.
10. Walk-in clinic note to be forwarded to Dr. Hannah Moreau at Hamilton Mountain FHT for continuity of care.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: With family physician (Dr. Moreau) in 2–3 weeks if symptoms persist, or sooner if worsening
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 4: 2025-06-10 — Annual Physical / Lipid Review + Smoking Cessation Maintenance

- Date: 2025-06-10
- Time: 10:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton)
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Annual health examination, dyslipidemia review, and smoking cessation maintenance

### Subjective
Mr. Ali presents for his annual physical examination and lipid management review. He reports feeling well overall. He has been taking Rosuvastatin 10 mg nightly consistently with good adherence. He continues to deny any statin-related side effects — specifically, no myalgias, muscle weakness, muscle cramps, or fatigue. No changes in urine colour. No gastrointestinal symptoms.

He mentions the episode of acute low back pain in February 2025 that was assessed at the Hamilton Medical Walk-in Centre. He followed conservative management as advised and the pain resolved fully within approximately 3 weeks. He gradually returned to recreational basketball in March 2025 and has had no recurrence. He has been more mindful of lifting technique since the injury.

Regarding smoking cessation, he notes that he reached his 5-year anniversary of being smoke-free in approximately March 2025. He has no cravings and is not exposed to secondhand smoke at home or at work. He does not use e-cigarettes or vaping products.

Diet and exercise: He has maintained his improved dietary habits from last year — cooking at home most weekdays, incorporating more fish, vegetables, and whole grains. He continues basketball once weekly, daily dog walking, and stationary cycling 1–2 times per week. He estimates approximately 160–200 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week.

Alcohol: 2–3 beers on weekends, unchanged. No recreational drug use.

No new medications, supplements, or allergies. No new symptoms.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 120/74 mmHg, HR 64 bpm, RR 14, Temp 36.5°C, SpO2 99% RA
- Height: 180 cm, Weight: 84.5 kg, BMI: 26.1 kg/m² (down from 85.2 kg in October 2024)
- General: Well-appearing male, no acute distress
- HEENT: Normal. No xanthelasma, no corneal arcus
- Cardiovascular: S1 S2 normal, no murmurs. Peripheral pulses 2+ bilaterally
- Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly
- Extremities: No edema
- Musculoskeletal: Lumbar spine — full, pain-free range of motion. No paraspinal tenderness. No residual findings from February 2025 low back strain.

Lab results (drawn 2025-06-03):
- Total cholesterol: 3.6 mmol/L
- LDL-C: 2.0 mmol/L (previous 2.2 in October 2024; pre-treatment baseline 4.1)
- HDL-C: 1.5 mmol/L (previous 1.4)
- Triglycerides: 0.9 mmol/L
- Non-HDL cholesterol: 2.1 mmol/L
- Fasting glucose: 4.9 mmol/L
- HbA1c: 5.2%
- Creatinine: 86 µmol/L, eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73m²
- ALT: 22 U/L
- CK: 138 U/L (normal; periodic monitoring given statin therapy)
- TSH: 1.9 mIU/L
- CBC: within normal limits

Cardiovascular risk assessment:
- Modified Framingham Risk Score recalculated: 10-year risk 6.2% (low risk). Risk has decreased from 7.8% in April 2024, reflecting improved lipid profile and longer duration of smoking cessation.

### Assessment
1. Dyslipidemia — well controlled on Rosuvastatin 10 mg. LDL-C now 2.0 mmol/L, representing a 51% reduction from the pre-treatment baseline of 4.1 mmol/L. This exceeds the CCS-recommended target of ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction for primary prevention. HDL-C has improved to 1.5 mmol/L with lifestyle modifications. Triglycerides normal. Non-HDL cholesterol 2.1 mmol/L (within target). ALT and CK normal — no evidence of statin hepatotoxicity or myopathy. Excellent response to therapy.
2. Former smoker — 5+ years of sustained cessation. Cardiovascular risk continues to decline. At this stage, the excess risk attributable to former smoking is diminishing significantly. Will continue to document smoking status and reinforce abstinence at future visits.
3. Cardiovascular risk — Modified Framingham 10-year risk 6.2% (low). All modifiable risk factors are well controlled. No indication for additional pharmacotherapy (e.g., ASA for primary prevention is not recommended in low-risk individuals per CCS 2021).
4. Weight — BMI 26.1. Gradual weight loss of 1.5 kg over the past year. Moving toward healthy BMI range.
5. Resolved acute low back strain (February 2025) — fully recovered. No residual findings.
6. Health maintenance — tetanus booster up to date. No colorectal cancer screening indicated until age 50.

### Plan
1. Continue Rosuvastatin 10 mg PO nightly — no dose change needed. LDL-C is at target.
2. Continue current dietary and exercise regimen — patient is meeting CCS lifestyle recommendations.
3. Smoking cessation maintenance — commended on 5+ years of cessation. No intervention needed. Will continue to document at annual visits.
4. Statin tolerability monitoring — CK and ALT normal today. Will recheck ALT at next annual visit. CK to be rechecked only if symptomatic.
5. Repeat fasting lipid panel in 12 months (at next annual physical, anticipated June 2026). Given stable control, annual monitoring is sufficient per CCS guidelines.
6. Fasting glucose and HbA1c normal — no diabetes risk at present. Recheck in 3 years per Diabetes Canada screening recommendations (or sooner if risk factors change).
7. Influenza vaccine — discussed. Patient to schedule at pharmacy in the fall.
8. Encouraged continued weight management — approaching healthy BMI range.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 6 months for interim lipid check and medication renewal, or sooner PRN
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 5: 2025-12-09 — Lipid Labs / Medication Renewal

- Date: 2025-12-09
- Time: 15:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton)
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Lipid panel follow-up, statin tolerability check, and Rosuvastatin prescription renewal

### Subjective
Mr. Ali presents for a routine follow-up to review his lipid panel and renew his Rosuvastatin prescription. He has been feeling well. He continues to take Rosuvastatin 10 mg nightly with good adherence. He denies any muscle pain, weakness, cramping, or tenderness. No changes in exercise tolerance. No gastrointestinal symptoms. No new complaints.

He reports maintaining his dietary and exercise habits. He has been less consistent with stationary cycling over the past two months due to a busy period at work, but continues basketball weekly and daily walking. He estimates approximately 130–150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week currently, slightly below his summer levels. He plans to resume cycling sessions after the holidays.

He remains smoke-free with no cravings. Alcohol intake unchanged. No new medications or supplements. No allergies.

He mentions he has noticed some mild seasonal stiffness in his lower back during cold weather, particularly in the mornings, but it is mild (1–2/10), resolves with movement within 15–20 minutes, and is not interfering with his activities. He attributes it to the cold and reduced stretching. No radiation, no neurological symptoms.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 122/76 mmHg, HR 70 bpm
- Weight: 85.4 kg, BMI: 26.4 kg/m² (up 0.9 kg from June 2025)

Lab results (drawn 2025-12-02):
- Total cholesterol: 3.7 mmol/L
- LDL-C: 2.1 mmol/L (previous 2.0 in June 2025)
- HDL-C: 1.4 mmol/L (previous 1.5)
- Triglycerides: 1.0 mmol/L
- Non-HDL cholesterol: 2.3 mmol/L
- ALT: 26 U/L (normal)

### Assessment
1. Dyslipidemia — well controlled on Rosuvastatin 10 mg. LDL-C 2.1 mmol/L, minimally increased from 2.0 mmol/L in June — not clinically significant and likely reflects slight dietary variation and reduced exercise intensity over the fall. Overall LDL-C reduction from pre-treatment baseline remains approximately 49%, near the 50% target. HDL-C slight dip from 1.5 to 1.4 mmol/L, likely related to modestly reduced physical activity. ALT normal, no hepatotoxicity. No myopathy symptoms. Statin therapy remains well tolerated.
2. Weight — modest increase of 0.9 kg since June, likely seasonal. BMI 26.4, still in overweight range but stable overall.
3. Mild seasonal low back stiffness — no red flags. Consistent with mechanical stiffness, potentially related to cold weather and reduced stretching. History of acute low back strain in February 2025 which fully resolved. No neurological symptoms. No investigation or treatment required at this time.
4. Former smoker — 5+ years sustained cessation. No concerns.
5. Cardiovascular risk — remains low based on most recent Framingham Risk Score (6.2% in June 2025). No interval changes to risk profile.

### Plan
1. Renew Rosuvastatin 10 mg PO nightly — prescription renewed for 12 months (365 days, 1 repeat).
2. Continue current dietary and exercise regimen. Encouraged patient to resume stationary cycling and maintain 150 minutes/week target through the winter.
3. For low back stiffness — encouraged daily lumbar stretching routine (reviewed knee-to-chest, cat-cow, and child's pose stretches). Advised to maintain core strengthening exercises. If symptoms worsen or new features develop (radiation, neurological symptoms, persistent pain > 4 weeks), to present for reassessment.
4. Repeat fasting lipid panel at next annual physical (anticipated June 2026). Lab requisition provided for late May 2026.
5. ALT monitoring — will recheck at annual physical. CK not indicated today as patient is asymptomatic.
6. Weight management — discussed strategies for maintaining healthy eating and exercise through the holiday season and winter months.
7. Influenza vaccine — patient reports he received his influenza vaccine at a pharmacy in November 2025. COVID-19 booster up to date.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: Annual physical in approximately 6 months (June 2026)
- Referrals: None
