## Encounter 1: 2024-03-19 — Chronic Low Back Pain Review

- Date: 2024-03-19
- Time: 10:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Kitchener-Waterloo Family Health Team
- Practitioner: Dr. Robert Osei, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-65189)
- Reason for visit: Chronic low back pain — periodic review and medication renewal

### Subjective
Mr. Kowalski presents for routine review of chronic mechanical low back pain, which he has managed for approximately six years. He describes his baseline pain as a dull ache across the lower lumbar region, typically rated 3–4/10 on a numeric pain scale at rest, increasing to 5–6/10 with prolonged standing or heavy lifting at work. He works as a warehouse associate at a distribution centre in Brantford, where his duties include loading and unloading pallets, operating a forklift, and extended periods of standing. He takes Naproxen 250 mg PRN, approximately 3–4 times per week, usually on work days when pain is more prominent. He reports the Naproxen provides partial relief, reducing pain by approximately 2 points within 45–60 minutes. He denies any radiating leg pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in the lower extremities. No bowel or bladder dysfunction. No saddle anesthesia. No recent falls or trauma.

He received a lumbar epidural steroid injection (L4-L5 level) in 2022 under the care of Dr. Greco at Kingston Health Sciences Centre, which he found moderately helpful for approximately four months. He has not pursued further injections. He completed a physiotherapy program (eight sessions) in 2022 following the injection but has not continued with structured exercise since.

Past medical history: Chronic mechanical low back pain (diagnosed approximately 2018). Lumbar epidural steroid injection (2022). No surgical history.

Medications: Naproxen 250 mg PO PRN (1 tablet up to TID with food).

Allergies: No known drug allergies.

Social history: Non-smoker. Social drinker (2–3 beers on weekends). Works full-time as a warehouse associate. Lives with wife and two children in Brantford, ON. Drives approximately 40 minutes each way to the KW FHT.

Family history: Father with osteoarthritis. Mother with hypertension. No family history of inflammatory arthropathy, malignancy, or autoimmune conditions.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 128/82 mmHg, HR 76 bpm, RR 14, Temp 36.5°C, SpO2 98% RA
- Height: 179 cm, Weight: 88.9 kg, BMI: 27.7 kg/m²
- General: Well-appearing male, no acute distress. Moves somewhat stiffly when rising from seated position.
- Spine inspection: No visible deformity, no scoliosis. No midline tenderness over spinous processes. Paraspinal muscle tenderness bilaterally at L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels. No step-off palpated.
- Range of motion: Lumbar flexion limited to approximately 60° (pain-limited). Extension 15° with discomfort. Lateral flexion and rotation grossly preserved.
- Neurologic: Straight leg raise negative bilaterally. Patellar reflexes 2+ bilaterally. Achilles reflexes 2+ bilaterally. Strength 5/5 in hip flexion, knee extension, ankle dorsiflexion, great toe extension, and ankle plantarflexion bilaterally. Sensation intact to light touch in L2–S1 dermatomes bilaterally.
- Gait: Normal heel and toe walking. No antalgic gait.
- Perianal exam: Deferred (no red flag symptoms).

### Assessment
1. Chronic mechanical low back pain — stable, ongoing. No neurologic deficits on examination. No red flags for cauda equina syndrome, malignancy, infection, or fracture. Pain is primarily axial and mechanical in nature, consistent with chronic musculoligamentous strain with likely contribution of degenerative changes at the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels. The patient's physically demanding occupation is a significant aggravating factor.
2. NSAID use — currently using Naproxen 250 mg PRN 3–4 times weekly. Tolerated well. No GI complaints. Will monitor renal function and GI risk given ongoing use.
3. Deconditioning — patient has not engaged in structured exercise or physiotherapy in approximately two years. Core strengthening and flexibility work would be beneficial.

### Plan
1. Continue Naproxen 250 mg PO PRN, 1 tablet up to TID with food. Counselled to take with meals and to limit use to no more than 10–14 days continuously. Advised to avoid combining with other NSAIDs or ASA.
2. Re-referral to physiotherapy — referred to the physiotherapy program at Kitchener-Waterloo FHT for core strengthening, lumbar stabilization exercises, and ergonomic education. Goal is 6–8 sessions with a home exercise program.
3. Discussed non-pharmacologic strategies: heat application, activity modification, avoid prolonged static postures at work, use lumbar support when seated.
4. Discussed the importance of maintaining a healthy weight and regular physical activity for chronic LBP management.
5. Lab requisition provided: CBC, creatinine, eGFR, urinalysis — to monitor for NSAID-related renal effects. Fasting glucose and lipid panel for general health screening.
6. Discussed opioid avoidance approach — patient is agreeable and has not requested opioids. Emphasized that current evidence does not support long-term opioids for chronic non-cancer pain and that the focus should remain on active rehabilitation and self-management.
7. If pain significantly worsens or neurologic symptoms develop, to return promptly or present to ED.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 6 months, or sooner if worsening
- Referrals: Physiotherapy — Kitchener-Waterloo FHT physiotherapy program

## Encounter 2: 2024-07-08 — Acute Low Back Pain Flare

- Date: 2024-07-08
- Time: 13:20
- Type: Walk-in
- Setting: Walk-in Clinic
- Organization: Hamilton Medical Walk-in Centre
- Practitioner: Dr. Lisa Fernandes, MD (ON-PRAC-44893)
- Reason for visit: Acute exacerbation of chronic low back pain after heavy lifting at work

### Subjective
Mr. Kowalski presents to the walk-in clinic with a 2-day history of significantly worsened low back pain. He reports that on Saturday (July 6), he was lifting a heavy crate at work (estimated 30–35 kg) with an awkward twisting motion when he felt a sudden sharp pain in his lower back. He immediately had difficulty straightening up. Since the incident, he has been unable to work and has been managing at home with rest, ice, and Naproxen 250 mg TID. He rates his current pain at 7–8/10, significantly above his baseline of 3–4/10. The pain is primarily located in the central and right-sided lower lumbar region. He reports some radiation into the right buttock but denies any radiation below the knee. No numbness, tingling, or weakness in the legs. No bowel or bladder dysfunction. No saddle anesthesia. No fever or night sweats.

He reports this is his worst flare in approximately two years. He mentions he has a history of chronic LBP and previously had a lumbar epidural steroid injection in 2022. He states he has been attending physiotherapy at the KW FHT (started in April 2024) and had completed three sessions before this episode.

He drove himself to the clinic from Brantford, as his wife is at work. The injury occurred at work, and he inquires about whether this would be covered under WSIB.

Medications: Naproxen 250 mg PO TID with food (increased frequency since the acute episode).

Allergies: NKDA.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 136/86 mmHg, HR 82 bpm, RR 16, Temp 36.7°C, SpO2 99% RA
- General: Appears uncomfortable. Antalgic posture with mild right lateral shift. Moves cautiously.
- Spine inspection: No bruising or swelling. Significant paraspinal muscle spasm palpable on the right at L4-L5 level. Midline spinous process tenderness at L4 and L5. Right-sided paraspinal tenderness greater than left.
- Range of motion: Lumbar flexion severely limited to approximately 30° (pain-limited). Extension 5° with marked discomfort. Right lateral flexion limited by pain. Left lateral flexion mildly limited.
- Neurologic: Straight leg raise positive on the right at approximately 50° (reproduces buttock pain, does not radiate below the knee). Negative on the left. Patellar reflexes 2+ bilaterally. Achilles reflexes 2+ bilaterally. Strength 5/5 in all major lower extremity muscle groups bilaterally. Sensation intact.
- Gait: Antalgic, favouring the right side. Able to heel and toe walk with mild difficulty.
- Red flag screen: No fever, no weight loss, no history of malignancy, no IV drug use, no immunosuppression, no urinary retention or fecal incontinence, no saddle anesthesia, no progressive neurologic deficit.

### Assessment
1. Acute exacerbation of chronic low back pain — likely acute musculoligamentous strain superimposed on chronic degenerative changes. Mechanism consistent with acute mechanical injury (heavy lifting with torsion). Right-sided SLR positive at 50° producing buttock pain only — suggests irritation of the right L5 or S1 nerve root but no definitive radiculopathy (no pain below knee, no neurologic deficit). No red flags for cauda equina syndrome, fracture, or serious spinal pathology.
2. Work-related injury — mechanism is consistent with an occupational injury. WSIB documentation may be warranted.

### Plan
1. Naproxen 500 mg PO BID with food for 7–10 days (increased dose for the acute flare period), then taper back to 250 mg PRN. Prescribed 20 tablets of Naproxen 500 mg. Counselled regarding GI protection — to take with food, consider addition of OTC famotidine 20 mg if any dyspepsia.
2. Cyclobenzaprine 5 mg PO at bedtime for 5–7 days for muscle spasm. Prescribed 7 tablets. Counselled regarding sedation — not to drive or operate heavy machinery until he knows how it affects him.
3. Ice application 15–20 minutes every 2–3 hours for the first 48 hours, then alternating with heat as tolerated.
4. Relative rest for 2–3 days. Encouraged gentle walking as tolerated. Strict bed rest is not recommended. Avoid heavy lifting, bending, and twisting until reassessed.
5. Off work for 5 days (July 8–12 inclusive). Medical note provided for employer. Advised to follow up with his family physician, Dr. Osei, within 1–2 weeks for reassessment and work clearance.
6. Discussed WSIB: advised that if this is a workplace injury, he should file a WSIB claim (Form 6 — Worker's Report of Injury) through his employer. The walk-in clinic has completed a WSIB Form 8 (Health Professional's Report) documenting the injury and diagnosis. The patient's family physician can manage ongoing WSIB reporting if needed.
7. Red flag counselling: instructed to proceed to the nearest emergency department immediately if he develops any of the following — loss of bowel or bladder control, saddle anesthesia, progressive weakness in the legs, bilateral leg pain, or fever with back pain.
8. Opioids were not prescribed. The patient did not request opioids. Discussed that NSAIDs and muscle relaxants are first-line for acute LBP and that opioids are associated with poorer long-term outcomes in this setting.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: With family physician Dr. Robert Osei within 1–2 weeks for reassessment
- Referrals: None. WSIB Form 8 completed and submitted.

## Encounter 3: 2024-10-01 — Physiotherapy Progress and Imaging Discussion

- Date: 2024-10-01
- Time: 14:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Kitchener-Waterloo Family Health Team
- Practitioner: Dr. Robert Osei, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-65189)
- Reason for visit: Follow-up on LBP — physiotherapy progress, consideration of imaging

### Subjective
Mr. Kowalski returns for scheduled follow-up. He reports that after the acute flare in July, he was off work for the initial 5 days and then returned on modified duties (light duties — no lifting over 10 kg, no repetitive bending) for an additional three weeks before returning to full duties in early August. The WSIB claim was approved and his modified duties were accommodated by his employer.

Since the acute flare, he has resumed physiotherapy at the KW FHT and has completed a total of seven sessions (three before the flare, four since returning). He reports that the physiotherapist has been working on core stabilization, lumbar multifidus activation, and hip mobility. He has a home exercise program that he performs 4–5 days per week (bird-dogs, dead bugs, bridges, prone press-ups). He finds the exercises helpful and notes that his baseline pain has improved somewhat compared to before the flare — currently 2–3/10 at rest, 4–5/10 at end of work day. The acute flare has fully resolved. No further episodes of acute exacerbation.

He has completed the short course of cyclobenzaprine and is no longer taking it. He has reduced his Naproxen use to 250 mg 2–3 times per week. He asks about whether imaging (X-ray or MRI) would be useful to "see what's going on" in his back. He has never had lumbar imaging.

No radiating leg pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness. No bowel or bladder symptoms. Sleep is occasionally disrupted by back pain when changing positions in bed, but generally adequate.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 124/80 mmHg, HR 74 bpm
- Weight: 88.2 kg, BMI: 27.5 kg/m² (slight decrease from March)
- Spine: Paraspinal tenderness mild bilaterally at L4-L5, improved from previous visits. No midline tenderness. No spasm palpable.
- Range of motion: Lumbar flexion approximately 70° (improved). Extension 20° with mild discomfort. Lateral flexion symmetric.
- Neurologic: Straight leg raise negative bilaterally. Reflexes 2+ and symmetric. Strength 5/5 in all lower extremity groups. Sensation intact.
- Gait: Normal. No antalgic component.

Lab results (drawn 2024-09-20):
- Creatinine: 82 µmol/L, eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73m²
- CBC: within normal limits
- Fasting glucose: 5.4 mmol/L
- Total cholesterol: 5.1 mmol/L, LDL 3.0 mmol/L, HDL 1.2 mmol/L, TG 1.8 mmol/L

### Assessment
1. Chronic mechanical low back pain — improving. The patient has made meaningful progress with physiotherapy and a structured home exercise program. Pain scores are below baseline. No neurologic deficits. No red flags. The acute work-related exacerbation in July has fully resolved.
2. Imaging discussion — in the absence of red flags, progressive neurologic deficits, or failure to improve with conservative management, routine lumbar imaging is not indicated per Canadian guidelines (Choosing Wisely Canada). Imaging findings (e.g., disc degeneration, bulging discs) are common in asymptomatic individuals and often do not correlate with symptoms. Discussed this in detail with the patient.
3. Renal function — normal. No evidence of NSAID nephrotoxicity.
4. Dyslipidemia — borderline LDL 3.0 mmol/L. Low cardiovascular risk at present. Will monitor.

### Plan
1. Continue Naproxen 250 mg PO PRN. Encouraged to continue reducing frequency as pain allows. Goal is to use only for breakthrough pain.
2. Continue physiotherapy home exercise program — core stabilization, hip mobility, and progressive loading. The physiotherapist will discharge him from supervised sessions after one more visit (session 8 of 8) with a maintenance home program.
3. Imaging deferred — explained rationale per Choosing Wisely Canada recommendations. Patient understands and is agreeable. If symptoms change (e.g., development of radiculopathy, failure to improve, new red flags), imaging will be reconsidered.
4. Workplace: patient has returned to full duties. Discussed ongoing ergonomic strategies — proper lifting technique (hinge at hips, engage core, keep load close to body), use of lifting aids when available, alternating tasks to avoid prolonged static postures.
5. WSIB file: patient reports his claim has been closed as he has returned to full duties. No further WSIB reporting required at this time.
6. General health: fasting glucose normal. Lipid panel borderline — reinforced healthy dietary choices and regular exercise. Will recheck in 1 year.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 4 months for pain management review
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 4: 2025-02-04 — Pain Management Review

- Date: 2025-02-04
- Time: 11:15
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Kitchener-Waterloo Family Health Team
- Practitioner: Dr. Robert Osei, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-65189)
- Reason for visit: Chronic low back pain — pain management review

### Subjective
Mr. Kowalski presents for his scheduled pain management review. He reports that overall, his back pain has been "the best it's been in a couple of years." He attributes this to the consistency of his home exercise program, which he has maintained since completing the physiotherapy sessions in October. He performs his core exercises (bird-dogs, dead bugs, bridges, and planks) 4–5 times per week, approximately 20 minutes per session. His baseline pain is 2–3/10 on most days, with occasional increases to 4–5/10 at the end of a busy work day. He has reduced his Naproxen use to approximately 1–2 times per week, typically on work days that involve heavier lifting.

He mentions that the winter weather and icy conditions have made him more cautious about slipping, but he has not had any falls. He has noticed some mild morning stiffness in his lower back lasting approximately 15–20 minutes, which resolves with movement. No night pain. No radiating pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness. No bowel or bladder symptoms.

He asks about topical alternatives to oral Naproxen for days when his pain is milder, as he would prefer to reduce oral NSAID use.

Sleep is adequate — approximately 7 hours per night. He bought a firmer mattress in November, which he feels has helped his morning pain.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 122/78 mmHg, HR 72 bpm, RR 14, Temp 36.5°C
- Weight: 87.5 kg, BMI: 27.3 kg/m² (gradual decrease from 88.9 kg in March 2024)
- Spine: Minimal paraspinal tenderness at L4-L5 bilaterally. No midline tenderness. No spasm.
- Range of motion: Lumbar flexion approximately 75° (best recorded). Extension 25° with minimal discomfort. Lateral flexion and rotation grossly normal.
- Neurologic: Abbreviated exam — SLR negative bilaterally. Strength grossly intact. Gait normal.

### Assessment
1. Chronic mechanical low back pain — well-managed with conservative measures. Patient is maintaining an active self-management approach with good results. Pain scores improved from baseline of 3–4/10 one year ago to 2–3/10 currently. Functional status is excellent — working full duties without restriction.
2. NSAID use — frequency has decreased appropriately. Patient's request for topical alternative is reasonable and may reduce systemic NSAID exposure.
3. Morning stiffness — brief (15–20 minutes), resolves with activity. Not suggestive of inflammatory spondyloarthropathy given the short duration and mechanical pattern. No other features of inflammatory back pain (no prolonged morning stiffness > 30 minutes, no improvement with exercise alone without mechanical trigger, no peripheral joint involvement, no family history of AS, no psoriasis, no IBD, no uveitis).
4. Weight — trending down slowly. BMI improved from 27.7 to 27.3 over 10 months. Encouraged continued efforts.

### Plan
1. Reduce oral Naproxen — prescribe Diclofenac 2.32% topical gel (Voltaren Emulgel), apply to lower back up to QID as needed. This provides local anti-inflammatory effect with minimal systemic absorption and reduced GI/renal risk compared to oral NSAIDs. Available OTC but provided prescription for potential insurance coverage.
2. Continue oral Naproxen 250 mg PRN for days with higher pain levels. Goal is to use oral NSAIDs no more than 1–2 times per week.
3. Continue home exercise program — emphasized that this is the most important component of his management. Discussed the option of a gym-based exercise program (deadlifts, squats with light weights) to continue progressive loading, if he is interested. Not mandatory.
4. No imaging indicated at this time given clinical improvement and absence of red flags.
5. Discussed the role of weight management in chronic LBP — even modest reductions in body weight can decrease mechanical load on the lumbar spine.
6. Return for annual physical in approximately 5–6 months (summer 2025). Will incorporate LBP review at that visit.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 5–6 months (annual physical and LBP review)
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 5: 2025-07-15 — Annual Physical / LBP Review

- Date: 2025-07-15
- Time: 09:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Kitchener-Waterloo Family Health Team
- Practitioner: Dr. Robert Osei, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-65189)
- Reason for visit: Annual health examination and chronic low back pain review

### Subjective
Mr. Kowalski presents for his annual physical examination combined with his chronic LBP review. He reports his back pain remains well-managed. He continues his home exercise program 4–5 times per week and has added light weight training at a local gym twice per week, focusing on deadlifts, goblet squats, and rows with guidance from a fitness trainer. He reports his baseline pain is 1–2/10 on most days, which he considers excellent relative to his history. He has occasional days at 3–4/10, typically after unusually heavy work days, which he manages with topical Diclofenac gel. He has taken oral Naproxen only twice in the past five months — both times after particularly strenuous shifts.

No radiating leg pain. No numbness, tingling, or weakness. No bowel or bladder symptoms. Morning stiffness is minimal — approximately 5 minutes. Sleep is good.

General health review: He feels well overall. No chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, abdominal symptoms, urinary symptoms, or mood concerns. He reports some mild seasonal allergies (nasal congestion in spring) managed with OTC cetirizine. No other medications. No changes to social history. He has cut back alcohol to 1–2 beers per week.

He asks about long-term prognosis for his back — whether he can expect to continue working in the warehouse into his 50s.

Immunizations: Influenza vaccine — will receive in fall. COVID-19 boosters up to date.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 120/76 mmHg, HR 70 bpm, RR 14, Temp 36.6°C, SpO2 99% RA
- Height: 179 cm, Weight: 86.4 kg, BMI: 27.0 kg/m²
- General: Well-appearing, good muscle tone, no acute distress
- HEENT: Pupils equal and reactive, oropharynx clear, no thyromegaly, TMs clear bilaterally
- Cardiovascular: S1 S2 normal, no murmurs, regular rate and rhythm, peripheral pulses 2+ bilaterally
- Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly, no hernias
- Musculoskeletal (lumbar): No paraspinal tenderness. No midline tenderness. Range of motion — flexion 80°, extension 25°, lateral flexion and rotation full and symmetric. Significantly improved from baseline.
- Neurologic: SLR negative bilaterally. Reflexes 2+ and symmetric (patellar, Achilles). Strength 5/5 in all lower extremity groups. Sensation intact L2–S1 bilaterally.
- Skin: No concerning lesions. No rashes.
- DRE: Deferred — no indication.

Lab results (drawn 2025-07-08):
- CBC: within normal limits
- Creatinine: 80 µmol/L, eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73m²
- Fasting glucose: 5.2 mmol/L
- HbA1c: 5.3% (screening — normal)
- Total cholesterol: 4.9 mmol/L, LDL 2.7 mmol/L, HDL 1.3 mmol/L, TG 1.5 mmol/L
- ALT: 28 U/L
- TSH: 2.4 mIU/L
- PSA: Not indicated at age 47 (discussed — will offer screening discussion at age 50 per CTFPHC guidelines)

### Assessment
1. Chronic mechanical low back pain — significantly improved with consistent active self-management. Pain scores at best levels in years (1–2/10 baseline). No neurologic deficits. Functional capacity excellent — full warehouse duties without restriction. The combination of core strengthening, progressive resistance training, ergonomic awareness, and weight reduction has been effective.
2. General health — no significant concerns. BMI trending toward normal range (27.0 from 27.7 over 16 months). Renal function normal with minimal oral NSAID use. Lipid panel improved. Fasting glucose and HbA1c normal.
3. Long-term prognosis discussion — counselled that with continued active management (exercise, weight control, ergonomic practices), there is no reason he cannot continue working in his current role. Discussed that chronic LBP is a fluctuating condition and flares may occur, but the overall trajectory is positive. If his occupational demands become unsustainable in the future, workplace accommodation, role modification, or vocational rehabilitation are options. No orthopedic referral needed at this time.
4. Health maintenance — age-appropriate screening up to date. Colon cancer screening: discussed. Will order FIT (fecal immunochemical test) as per Ontario ColonCancyScreening program — eligible at age 50 (2027). Blood pressure well-controlled. No indication for ASA or statin at current cardiovascular risk level.

### Plan
1. Continue topical Diclofenac gel PRN for mild pain days. Keep oral Naproxen 250 mg available for breakthrough pain only.
2. Continue home exercise program and gym-based progressive resistance training. This is the cornerstone of his management.
3. Continue weight management efforts — patient is making excellent progress.
4. Lab work: repeat CBC, creatinine, eGFR, fasting glucose, and lipid panel in 1 year.
5. Influenza vaccine: to receive at fall flu clinic. COVID-19 booster as per public health schedule.
6. FIT screening for colorectal cancer: to begin at age 50 (2027) per Ontario screening guidelines.
7. Return for LBP review in approximately 6 months, or sooner if any worsening. Annual physical in 1 year.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 6 months for LBP review, or sooner if worsening
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 6: 2025-12-09 — Medication Renewal and Workplace Ergonomics

- Date: 2025-12-09
- Time: 15:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Kitchener-Waterloo Family Health Team
- Practitioner: Dr. Robert Osei, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-65189)
- Reason for visit: Medication renewal and workplace ergonomics discussion

### Subjective
Mr. Kowalski presents for his scheduled LBP follow-up. He reports his back has been "doing well overall." His baseline pain remains 1–2/10 on most days. He had one brief flare in late October (pain 5/10 for approximately three days) after helping a coworker move a heavy piece of equipment at work. He managed this with topical Diclofenac gel, ice, and a temporary reduction in his gym workouts. The flare resolved without requiring oral Naproxen or time off work. He has continued his home exercise program and gym sessions without modification since then.

He reports that his employer is implementing a new health and safety program in the warehouse and has asked employees to identify any ergonomic concerns. His supervisor has requested a letter from his physician outlining any workplace accommodations or ergonomic recommendations. He would like to discuss what recommendations would be appropriate.

He is running low on his supply of oral Naproxen 250 mg and would like a renewal, though he emphasizes he has used it very infrequently — approximately once per month.

He also mentions he has been experiencing some mild right knee discomfort over the past two weeks, which he attributes to increasing his squat weight at the gym. It is mild, no swelling, no locking, no giving way. He has reduced his squat volume in the interim.

No radiating leg pain from the back. No numbness, tingling, or weakness. No bowel or bladder symptoms. Sleep is good.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 126/78 mmHg, HR 74 bpm, RR 14, Temp 36.5°C
- Weight: 86.0 kg, BMI: 26.8 kg/m²
- Lumbar spine: No paraspinal tenderness. No midline tenderness. Range of motion — flexion 80°, extension 25°, full lateral flexion and rotation bilaterally. No spasm.
- Neurologic (abbreviated): SLR negative bilaterally. Gait normal. Strength grossly intact.
- Right knee: No effusion. No warmth. Full range of motion (0–135°). No ligamentous laxity (anterior/posterior drawer negative, varus/valgus stress negative). No joint line tenderness. Patellar grind test mildly positive. No McMurray sign.

### Assessment
1. Chronic mechanical low back pain — well-controlled, stable. Patient demonstrates excellent self-management. Brief flare in October was appropriately managed without escalation. No neurologic deficits. Functional status excellent.
2. Medication renewal — Naproxen 250 mg PRN. Infrequent use (approximately monthly). Continued low-dose PRN use is reasonable with periodic renal monitoring.
3. Workplace ergonomics — patient requests physician letter for employer health and safety program. Appropriate and supportive of long-term injury prevention.
4. Right knee — mild patellofemoral pain, likely related to increased loading with squats. No red flags. No effusion or mechanical symptoms. Self-limiting with activity modification.

### Plan
1. Renew Naproxen 250 mg PO PRN, 1 tablet up to TID with food. Quantity: 60 tablets with 1 repeat. Continue to use sparingly.
2. Continue topical Diclofenac gel PRN for mild LBP and right knee discomfort.
3. Workplace ergonomics letter — will provide a letter for the employer's health and safety program outlining the following recommendations:
   - Avoid repetitive heavy lifting exceeding 25 kg without mechanical assistance (pallet jack, forklift, team lift)
   - Alternation of tasks to avoid prolonged static standing (greater than 1 hour without a change in position)
   - Access to an anti-fatigue mat at workstations involving prolonged standing
   - Availability of a lumbar support cushion for forklift seat
   - Encourage use of proper lifting biomechanics (hip hinge, neutral spine, load close to body)
   - These are general ergonomic recommendations to prevent injury exacerbation, not formal workplace restrictions. The patient is currently working full duties without restriction.
4. Right knee: advised to reduce squat depth and weight temporarily, focus on partial range of motion and gradual progressive loading. If symptoms persist beyond 4–6 weeks or worsen, will reassess with potential imaging.
5. Lab requisition provided: creatinine, eGFR — to monitor with ongoing (albeit infrequent) NSAID use. To be drawn before next visit.
6. No orthopedic referral required at this time. If LBP worsens or neurologic symptoms develop, referral to Dr. Anthony Greco at Kingston Health Sciences Centre Orthopedics remains an option.
7. Annual physical scheduled for July 2026.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: Annual physical July 2026, or sooner if LBP or knee symptoms worsen
- Referrals: None. Workplace ergonomics letter to be mailed to patient within 1 week.
