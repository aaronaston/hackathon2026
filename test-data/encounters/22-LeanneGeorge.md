## Encounter 1: 2024-03-12 — Annual Physical Examination / Diabetes & Hypertension Review

- Date: 2024-03-12
- Time: 10:15
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Sudbury-Manitoulin Family Health Team, 865 Regent St, Suite 210, Sudbury, ON
- Practitioner: Dr. Anita Chakraborty, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-68390)
- Reason for visit: Annual health examination; ongoing management of type 2 diabetes and hypertension

### Subjective
Ms. George presents for her annual physical examination. She reports generally feeling well. She has been adherent to metformin 500 mg BID and ramipril 10 mg daily. She notes occasional mild fatigue in the afternoons, which she attributes to long shifts at work. She denies polyuria, polydipsia, visual changes, chest pain, or shortness of breath. She reports occasional numbness in her feet, particularly when sitting for prolonged periods, but denies persistent paresthesias or foot wounds. Diet has been "fair" — she acknowledges challenges with consistent meal planning, particularly when working evenings. She walks 20–30 minutes most days. She has not had a retinal screening in over 18 months. She is a non-smoker, drinks alcohol socially (1–2 drinks per month). No recent travel. She drove approximately 3 hours from Sault Ste. Marie for today's appointment.

Family history is notable for type 2 diabetes in her mother and maternal grandmother, and hypertension in her father, all of whom are First Nations. She notes that her mother developed kidney disease associated with diabetes. She expresses some concern about following the same trajectory.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 138/84 mmHg (seated, left arm), HR 76 bpm regular, RR 16, Temp 36.6 C, SpO2 98% RA
- Height: 162 cm
- Weight: 80.1 kg
- BMI: 30.5 kg/m2
- General: Well-appearing, no acute distress
- HEENT: Pupils equal and reactive, oropharynx clear, no thyromegaly
- CVS: S1 S2 normal, no murmurs, no peripheral edema
- Resp: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly
- Feet: Skin intact bilaterally, no calluses or ulceration. Pedal pulses 2+ bilaterally. Monofilament testing: intact sensation at 8/10 sites bilaterally (diminished at bilateral 5th metatarsal heads)
- Labs (drawn 2024-03-05, results available):
  - A1c: 7.4%
  - Fasting glucose: 8.2 mmol/L
  - Creatinine: 72 umol/L
  - eGFR: 88 mL/min/1.73m2
  - Urine ACR: 4.8 mg/mmol (mildly elevated; normal < 2.0)
  - Fasting lipid panel: Total cholesterol 4.9 mmol/L, LDL 2.7 mmol/L, HDL 1.3 mmol/L, TG 1.9 mmol/L
  - TSH: 2.1 mIU/L (normal)
  - CBC: within normal limits

### Assessment
1. **Type 2 diabetes mellitus** — A1c 7.4%, slightly above the Diabetes Canada target of <= 7.0% for most adults. Current metformin 500 mg BID provides moderate glycemic control. Subtle peripheral sensory changes noted on monofilament exam — early peripheral neuropathy cannot be excluded.
2. **Essential hypertension** — BP 138/84 today; approaching but not at the Diabetes Canada target of < 130/80 for patients with diabetes. Ramipril 10 mg daily is at target dose.
3. **Mildly elevated urine ACR (4.8 mg/mmol)** — Suggests early diabetic nephropathy (A2 category albuminuria). eGFR preserved at 88. Family history of diabetic kidney disease is a significant risk factor. Repeat ACR recommended to confirm, given that single elevated result may be transient. The higher prevalence of diabetic nephropathy in Indigenous populations warrants close surveillance.
4. **Overdue retinal screening** — Last dilated fundoscopy > 18 months ago. Referral indicated given diabetes duration and suboptimal A1c.
5. **Overweight (BMI 30.5)** — Counselled on dietary strategies; patient receptive.

### Plan
1. Continue metformin 500 mg BID; will consider intensification at next A1c check if not at target
2. Continue ramipril 10 mg daily (renoprotective and antihypertensive)
3. Repeat urine ACR in 3 months to confirm albuminuria; if persistent, consider nephrology referral
4. Repeat A1c in 3 months
5. Referral to ophthalmology for dilated retinal exam — will send to Grand River Hospital Ophthalmology (Dr. Karen Liu) given availability; patient may also access teleophthalmology through the Ontario Telemedicine Network if scheduling proves difficult
6. Discussed Ontario Diabetes Strategy resources, including diabetes education and Indigenous-specific supports through the local Aboriginal Health Access Centre
7. Foot care: annual podiatry assessment recommended; counselled on daily foot inspection
8. Lipid panel mildly above optimal for a patient with diabetes — discussed statin therapy; patient would like to first attempt dietary modification and reassess in 6 months
9. Provided Diabetes Canada nutrition guide and referred to the FHT's registered dietitian (waitlist approximately 6 weeks)
10. Flu and COVID-19 vaccine status reviewed — up to date

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 3 months (June 2024) with NP Derek Lapointe for A1c and renal function follow-up
- Referrals: Ophthalmology (Dr. Karen Liu, Grand River Hospital); FHT Registered Dietitian

---

## Encounter 2: 2024-06-18 — A1c and Renal Function Follow-up

- Date: 2024-06-18
- Time: 14:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Sudbury-Manitoulin Family Health Team, 865 Regent St, Suite 210, Sudbury, ON
- Practitioner: NP Derek Lapointe, MN NP-PHC (ON-NP-51087)
- Reason for visit: Three-month follow-up for A1c and repeat urine ACR; ongoing diabetes and hypertension management

### Subjective
Ms. George returns for her 3-month follow-up as arranged by Dr. Chakraborty. She reports continued adherence to metformin 500 mg BID and ramipril 10 mg daily. She saw the FHT dietitian 4 weeks ago and has been working on portion control and reducing refined carbohydrate intake. She reports she is now walking 30–40 minutes daily, 5 days per week. She feels her energy has improved somewhat. She denies new symptoms including polyuria, polydipsia, visual changes, numbness, tingling, chest pain, or dyspnea. She continues to drive from Sault Ste. Marie for appointments but notes the travel is becoming burdensome, particularly with work scheduling. She asks about the possibility of virtual follow-up for routine visits.

She has not yet received the ophthalmology appointment — she called Grand River Hospital and was told the waitlist is approximately 6–8 months. She is frustrated by the wait.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 134/82 mmHg (seated, left arm), HR 72 bpm regular, RR 14, Temp 36.5 C
- Weight: 79.3 kg (down 0.8 kg from March)
- BMI: 30.2 kg/m2
- General: Well, comfortable
- Labs (drawn 2024-06-11):
  - A1c: 7.2% (improved from 7.4% in March)
  - Fasting glucose: 7.8 mmol/L
  - Creatinine: 74 umol/L
  - eGFR: 86 mL/min/1.73m2
  - Urine ACR: 5.1 mg/mmol (persistent mild elevation, confirming A2 albuminuria)

### Assessment
1. **Type 2 diabetes mellitus** — A1c improved to 7.2% with dietary modifications and increased physical activity. Trending toward the <= 7.0% target. Metformin dose unchanged. Encouraging trajectory.
2. **Essential hypertension** — BP 134/82, improved from prior; approaching the < 130/80 target for patients with diabetes. Ramipril at maximally tolerated dose.
3. **Confirmed A2 albuminuria (urine ACR 5.1 mg/mmol)** — Two consecutive elevated ACR results confirm persistent albuminuria in the A2 range (2–20 mg/mmol). eGFR stable at 86. This represents early diabetic kidney disease (stage G2 A2). Given the family history of diabetic nephropathy and Indigenous heritage — a population with higher risk of progression — nephrology referral is warranted for co-management and risk stratification.
4. **Pending ophthalmology appointment** — Waitlist 6–8 months is concerning given overdue screening. Will explore expedited access.

### Plan
1. Continue metformin 500 mg BID — A1c improving; will reassess in 3–6 months. If A1c does not reach <= 7.0% at next check, discuss intensification (SGLT2 inhibitor would also provide renoprotective benefit given confirmed albuminuria)
2. Continue ramipril 10 mg daily
3. Referral to nephrology — Dr. Fatima Al-Rashid at Kingston Health Sciences Centre, Nephrology Clinic. Discussed with patient that this is a further drive but Dr. Al-Rashid has availability for OTN virtual consult for initial assessment, which would reduce travel burden
4. Follow up with ophthalmology scheduling — NP will contact Grand River Hospital to request prioritization given diabetes with suboptimal control and overdue screening; will also explore Ontario Telemedicine Network retinal screening program
5. Discussed virtual visit options with patient: FHT can offer OTN video visits for routine follow-ups, which would avoid the 3-hour drive. Patient is agreeable and has reliable internet access at home
6. Continue dietary modifications and physical activity — positive trends acknowledged and reinforced
7. Will discuss case with Dr. Chakraborty regarding overall management plan

### Disposition
- Follow-up: October 2024 with Dr. Chakraborty (may be virtual via OTN) to review nephrology consult results
- Referrals: Nephrology — Dr. Fatima Al-Rashid, Kingston Health Sciences Centre (OTN virtual consult requested)

---

## Encounter 3: 2024-08-22 — Nephrology Consultation — Elevated ACR

- Date: 2024-08-22
- Time: 11:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Specialist Clinic (Virtual — Ontario Telemedicine Network)
- Organization: Kingston Health Sciences Centre — Nephrology
- Practitioner: Dr. Fatima Al-Rashid, MD FRCPC (ON-PRAC-79207)
- Reason for visit: Nephrology consultation for persistent A2 albuminuria in the setting of type 2 diabetes; referral from Sudbury-Manitoulin FHT

### Subjective
Ms. George is seen via OTN video consultation from the Sudbury-Manitoulin FHT telehealth suite. She was referred by NP Derek Lapointe and Dr. Anita Chakraborty for evaluation of persistent albuminuria. She reports no urinary symptoms, no hematuria, no flank pain, no lower extremity edema, and no foamy urine. She feels generally well. She has been compliant with metformin 500 mg BID and ramipril 10 mg daily. She is aware that her mother developed diabetic kidney disease requiring dialysis in her 60s and is understandably anxious about her own kidney health.

She identifies as Anishinaabe First Nations. She does not currently access care through a First Nations community health centre but is open to connecting with Indigenous-specific health supports if available. She reports a supportive family network.

Review of referral documentation reviewed in advance of appointment: two consecutive urine ACR values of 4.8 and 5.1 mg/mmol, eGFR stable 86–88, A1c 7.2–7.4%.

### Objective
- Virtual exam — limited physical examination
- Vitals (obtained by RN at FHT telehealth suite prior to call): BP 132/80 mmHg, HR 74 bpm, Weight 79.0 kg
- Review of labs provided in referral:
  - A1c: 7.2% (June 2024)
  - Creatinine: 74 umol/L, eGFR 86 (June 2024)
  - Urine ACR: 4.8 mg/mmol (March 2024), 5.1 mg/mmol (June 2024)
  - Lipids, CBC, electrolytes: within normal limits
- Additional labs ordered by nephrology and drawn at local lab in Sault Ste. Marie (2024-08-15):
  - Creatinine: 76 umol/L
  - eGFR: 84 mL/min/1.73m2
  - Urine ACR: 5.4 mg/mmol
  - Cystatin C: mildly elevated (consistent with early CKD)
  - Phosphate, calcium, PTH, albumin: all within normal limits
  - Urine R&M: no hematuria, no casts

### Assessment
1. **Early diabetic kidney disease — CKD stage G2 A2** (eGFR 84, ACR 5.4 mg/mmol). Three consecutive ACR values confirm persistent A2 albuminuria. No evidence of non-diabetic kidney disease based on bland urine sediment, normal complement (from prior bloodwork), and clinical history consistent with diabetic nephropathy. Family history of diabetic nephropathy in First Nations mother is a significant risk factor. The disproportionate burden of CKD in Indigenous populations is well-documented and multifactorial.
2. **Type 2 diabetes mellitus** — A1c 7.2%, not yet at target. An SGLT2 inhibitor would offer dual benefit of glycemic control and renoprotection (CREDENCE trial evidence).
3. **Essential hypertension** — BP 132/80 on ramipril 10 mg. Adequate.

### Plan
1. **Strongly recommend addition of an SGLT2 inhibitor** — Empagliflozin 10 mg daily or dapagliflozin 10 mg daily. This class has demonstrated reduction in CKD progression and albuminuria independent of glycemic effect (DAPA-CKD, CREDENCE, EMPA-KIDNEY trials). Will communicate recommendation to Dr. Chakraborty for prescribing.
2. Continue ramipril 10 mg daily — cornerstone of nephroprotection with RAAS blockade
3. Continue metformin 500 mg BID — safe at current eGFR; monitor if eGFR declines below 30
4. Target A1c <= 7.0% — acknowledge patient is approaching target
5. BP target < 130/80 — current BP near target; monitor
6. Monitor urine ACR and eGFR every 6 months
7. Discussed prognosis: at this stage, with appropriate treatment (SGLT2i + RAAS blockade + glycemic/BP optimization), risk of progression to advanced CKD can be substantially mitigated. Reassured patient while validating her concerns about family history
8. Encouraged connection with the Sault Ste. Marie Aboriginal Health Access Centre for culturally grounded diabetes and chronic disease supports
9. Consultation report to be sent to Dr. Chakraborty and NP Lapointe
10. Follow-up with nephrology in 12 months or sooner if eGFR declines > 5 mL/min/year or ACR rises significantly

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 12 months with nephrology (virtual via OTN), sooner if indicated
- Referrals: None additional; recommendations communicated to FHT

## Encounter 4: 2024-10-08 — Family Physician Follow-up Post-Nephrology Consultation

- Date: 2024-10-08
- Time: 09:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team (Virtual — OTN video visit)
- Organization: Sudbury-Manitoulin Family Health Team, 865 Regent St, Suite 210, Sudbury, ON
- Practitioner: Dr. Anita Chakraborty, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-68390)
- Reason for visit: Review nephrology consultation results; discuss medication adjustment; ongoing diabetes and hypertension management

### Subjective
Ms. George is seen via OTN video visit from her home in Sault Ste. Marie. She reports she reviewed the nephrology consultation summary that was shared with her via the patient portal. She understands that she has early kidney involvement from diabetes and is motivated to take steps to protect her kidney function. She asks about the recommended SGLT2 inhibitor — specifically about side effects and cost. She has Ontario Drug Benefit coverage through Non-Insured Health Benefits (NIHB) as a Status First Nations person, which covers most medications.

She continues to feel well. No new symptoms. She has been maintaining dietary changes and walking regularly. She reports she connected with the Sault Ste. Marie Indian Friendship Centre for a diabetes wellness group and has attended two sessions. She found it helpful and plans to continue.

She still has not received the ophthalmology appointment date. She is increasingly concerned.

### Objective
- Virtual visit — limited physical examination
- Patient-reported vitals (home BP monitor, validated device): BP 130/78 mmHg (average of 3 readings over past week), HR 70 bpm
- Patient-reported weight: 78.5 kg (down from 80.1 kg in March)
- Labs (drawn 2024-10-01):
  - A1c: 7.1%
  - Creatinine: 75 umol/L
  - eGFR: 85 mL/min/1.73m2

### Assessment
1. **Type 2 diabetes mellitus** — A1c 7.1%, continuing to improve. Nearing the <= 7.0% target. Lifestyle modifications producing measurable benefit.
2. **Early diabetic kidney disease — CKD G2 A2** — eGFR stable at 85. Nephrology recommends SGLT2 inhibitor for renoprotection. This aligns with Diabetes Canada 2024 guidelines recommending SGLT2i in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD.
3. **Essential hypertension** — Home BP 130/78, at target for diabetes.
4. **Overdue retinal screening** — Now more than 2 years since last dilated exam. This is unacceptable given diabetes. Will escalate.

### Plan
1. **Initiate empagliflozin 10 mg PO daily** — Discussed mechanism, benefits (renoprotection, modest glycemic improvement, possible cardiovascular benefit), and side effects (genital mycotic infections, polyuria, rare DKA). Patient understands and consents. Confirmed NIHB formulary coverage. Provided instructions on genital hygiene and hydration. Script sent electronically to patient's pharmacy in Sault Ste. Marie.
2. Continue metformin 500 mg BID
3. Continue ramipril 10 mg daily
4. A1c to be repeated in 3 months (January 2025) — expect further improvement with empagliflozin added
5. Renal function (creatinine, eGFR) to be checked in 4 weeks after starting empagliflozin (expected initial dip in eGFR of up to 10–15% is normal and not a reason to discontinue)
6. Ophthalmology — Dr. Chakraborty will personally contact Grand River Hospital Ophthalmology to request urgent prioritization. If not available within 8 weeks, will arrange retinal screening through the OTN teleophthalmology program or the Northern Ontario School of Medicine mobile screening unit
7. Encouraged continued participation in Indigenous diabetes wellness programming
8. Positive reinforcement of weight loss (1.6 kg since March) and lifestyle changes
9. Discussed statin therapy again — patient now willing to consider; will reassess at January visit with updated lipid panel

### Disposition
- Follow-up: January 2025 with NP Lapointe or Dr. Chakraborty for A1c, renal function, and statin discussion
- Referrals: Ophthalmology escalation in progress

---

## Encounter 5: 2025-01-14 — A1c Follow-up / Diabetes Management

- Date: 2025-01-14
- Time: 13:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team (Virtual — OTN video visit)
- Organization: Sudbury-Manitoulin Family Health Team, 865 Regent St, Suite 210, Sudbury, ON
- Practitioner: Dr. Anita Chakraborty, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-68390)
- Reason for visit: Three-month follow-up for A1c, renal function monitoring on empagliflozin, and diabetes management

### Subjective
Ms. George reports she has been taking empagliflozin 10 mg daily since mid-October without significant side effects. She experienced mild increased urinary frequency in the first 2 weeks, which has since resolved. No genital infections, no symptoms of DKA, no hypoglycemia. She continues metformin 500 mg BID and ramipril 10 mg daily without issues.

She reports the diabetes wellness group at the Indian Friendship Centre paused for the holidays but will restart in February. She has maintained her walking routine despite winter weather by using a treadmill at the local community centre. Diet has been reasonably consistent, though she admits the holiday period was challenging.

She received an ophthalmology appointment for March 2025 at Grand River Hospital — relieved to finally have a date. The appointment will require travel to Kitchener but she has arranged a ride with her sister who lives in Barrie.

She asks about whether she should be on a statin, noting that a friend with diabetes was recently started on one.

### Objective
- Virtual visit — limited physical examination
- Patient-reported vitals: BP 128/76 mmHg (home monitor average), HR 68 bpm
- Patient-reported weight: 77.8 kg (down from 78.5 kg in October)
- Labs (drawn 2025-01-07):
  - A1c: 6.9% (down from 7.1% in October)
  - Fasting glucose: 7.0 mmol/L
  - Creatinine: 80 umol/L
  - eGFR: 80 mL/min/1.73m2 (expected mild dip on SGLT2i — hemodynamic effect)
  - Urine ACR: 3.8 mg/mmol (improved from 5.4 in August; SGLT2i effect likely contributing)
  - Fasting lipid panel: Total cholesterol 4.7 mmol/L, LDL 2.5 mmol/L, HDL 1.4 mmol/L, TG 1.7 mmol/L

### Assessment
1. **Type 2 diabetes mellitus** — A1c 6.9%, now at the <= 7.0% target. Excellent response to empagliflozin addition plus ongoing lifestyle changes. Total weight loss of 2.3 kg since March 2024.
2. **Early diabetic kidney disease — CKD G2 A2** — eGFR 80 (expected hemodynamic dip on SGLT2i; not concerning). Urine ACR improved to 3.8 from 5.4, consistent with known SGLT2i albuminuria-lowering effect. Very encouraging.
3. **Essential hypertension** — Home BP 128/76, at target.
4. **Dyslipidemia in diabetes** — LDL 2.5 mmol/L. Diabetes Canada guidelines recommend statin therapy for most patients with diabetes over age 40 with LDL > 2.0 mmol/L or additional risk factors. Ms. George has diabetes, hypertension, CKD, and age > 40. Statin is indicated.
5. **Ophthalmology** — appointment confirmed for March 2025.

### Plan
1. Continue empagliflozin 10 mg daily — well-tolerated, effective
2. Continue metformin 500 mg BID
3. Continue ramipril 10 mg daily
4. **Initiate rosuvastatin 10 mg PO daily** — Discussed cardiovascular risk reduction in diabetes with concurrent CKD and hypertension. Patient understands benefits and agrees to start. Common side effects reviewed (myalgia, GI upset). Will check CK and ALT at 3-month follow-up. Script sent to pharmacy. Confirmed NIHB coverage.
5. Ophthalmology appointment March 2025 — patient to keep; no further action needed
6. Repeat A1c, renal function, and urine ACR in 6 months (June/July 2025)
7. Congratulated patient on achieving A1c target — emphasized importance of sustaining current approach
8. Encouraged reconnection with diabetes wellness group when it restarts

### Disposition
- Follow-up: Post-ophthalmology review in April 2025; routine A1c and renal function in 6 months
- Referrals: None new; ophthalmology appointment confirmed

## Encounter 6: 2025-03-19 — Retinal Screening — Ophthalmology

- Date: 2025-03-19
- Time: 10:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Specialist Clinic
- Organization: Grand River Hospital — Ophthalmology, Kitchener, ON
- Practitioner: Dr. Karen Liu, MD FRCSC (ON-PRAC-80529)
- Reason for visit: Diabetic retinal screening; referral from Dr. Anita Chakraborty

### Subjective
Ms. George presents for diabetic retinal screening. She was referred in March 2024 and has been on the waitlist for approximately 12 months. She reports no visual symptoms — no blurring, no floaters, no visual field deficits, no difficulty with night driving. She notes she wears reading glasses (OTC +1.5) for close work. She drove from Sault Ste. Marie with her sister for today's appointment. She reports her diabetes is well-controlled on metformin 500 mg BID and empagliflozin 10 mg daily (A1c 6.9% in January 2025). She also takes ramipril 10 mg daily and recently started rosuvastatin 10 mg daily.

### Objective
- Visual acuity (corrected): OD 20/25, OS 20/25
- Intraocular pressure: OD 16 mmHg, OS 15 mmHg (normal)
- Slit lamp examination: Anterior segments unremarkable bilaterally. No rubeosis iridis.
- Dilated fundoscopy:
  - **Right eye (OD):** Scattered dot and blot hemorrhages in the temporal macula and nasal retina. Two microaneurysms noted superotemporally. No hard exudates. No cotton-wool spots. No neovascularization. No vitreous hemorrhage. Optic disc normal.
  - **Left eye (OS):** Scattered dot hemorrhages in the posterior pole. One microaneurysm noted temporally. No hard exudates. No cotton-wool spots. No neovascularization. Optic disc normal.
  - **Macula:** No clinically significant macular edema bilaterally.
- OCT macula: No macular edema. Central macular thickness within normal limits bilaterally.
- Fundus photography: obtained for documentation and comparison.

### Assessment
1. **Mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), bilateral** — Mild background changes with scattered dot-blot hemorrhages and rare microaneurysms. No hard exudates, no macular edema, no neovascularization. Classified as mild NPDR by the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale.
2. This is an expected finding given her duration of type 2 diabetes and prior suboptimal glycemic control. The recent improvement in A1c to 6.9% is protective against progression.

### Plan
1. No ophthalmic treatment required at this time — mild NPDR is managed by optimizing systemic risk factors (glycemia, BP, lipids)
2. Repeat dilated retinal exam in 12 months — important to monitor for progression to moderate NPDR or development of macular edema
3. Consultation report to be sent to Dr. Anita Chakraborty at Sudbury-Manitoulin FHT
4. If any visual symptoms develop before next appointment (new floaters, sudden vision loss, flashing lights), patient instructed to seek urgent ophthalmic assessment
5. Discussed that continued glycemic and blood pressure control is the most important modifiable factor in slowing retinopathy progression
6. Patient to continue follow-up with FHT for systemic management
7. Next ophthalmology appointment: March 2026 — will attempt to coordinate with OTN teleophthalmology retinal imaging in Sault Ste. Marie to reduce travel burden

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 12 months with ophthalmology (March 2026)
- Referrals: Consultation report to Dr. Chakraborty

## Encounter 7: 2025-04-15 — Retinal Results Review / Diabetes Intensification Discussion

- Date: 2025-04-15
- Time: 11:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team (Virtual — OTN video visit)
- Organization: Sudbury-Manitoulin Family Health Team, 865 Regent St, Suite 210, Sudbury, ON
- Practitioner: Dr. Anita Chakraborty, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-68390)
- Reason for visit: Review ophthalmology consultation results; ongoing diabetes management

### Subjective
Ms. George is seen via OTN video from home to review her ophthalmology results. She received a copy of Dr. Liu's report and understands she has "early changes" in both eyes from diabetes. She is concerned but not alarmed, as Dr. Liu reassured her that no treatment was needed now. She asks what else she can do to prevent it from worsening.

She reports continued adherence to all medications: metformin 500 mg BID, empagliflozin 10 mg daily, ramipril 10 mg daily, rosuvastatin 10 mg daily. She has tolerated rosuvastatin well — no myalgia, no GI symptoms. She has continued walking and dietary management. Weight is stable around 77–78 kg.

She expresses mild frustration that despite doing "everything right," she is still developing complications. Discussed the natural history of diabetes and the importance of her proactive approach in slowing progression.

### Objective
- Virtual visit
- Patient-reported vitals: BP 126/76 mmHg (home monitor average), HR 70 bpm
- Patient-reported weight: 77.5 kg
- Labs (drawn 2025-04-08):
  - A1c: 7.0% (slight uptick from 6.9% in January — within measurement variability)
  - Creatinine: 78 umol/L
  - eGFR: 82 mL/min/1.73m2
  - ALT: 22 U/L (normal — statin monitoring)
  - CK: 95 U/L (normal — statin monitoring)
- Ophthalmology report (Dr. Karen Liu, 2025-03-19) reviewed: Mild NPDR bilateral, no macular edema, follow-up in 12 months

### Assessment
1. **Mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, bilateral** — Now confirmed. No treatment required. Systemic optimization is the management strategy. Next retinal exam in 12 months.
2. **Type 2 diabetes mellitus** — A1c 7.0%, at target. However, given the confirmed microvascular complications (retinopathy + nephropathy), there is a question of whether tighter glycemic control (A1c < 7.0%) would be beneficial. Must balance against hypoglycemia risk. Current regimen achieving reasonable control.
3. **Early diabetic kidney disease — CKD G2 A2** — eGFR stable at 82 (within expected range on SGLT2i). Nephrology follow-up due in August 2025.
4. **Essential hypertension** — Well-controlled at 126/76.
5. **Statin tolerance** — Rosuvastatin well-tolerated, normal ALT and CK.
6. **Emotional well-being** — Patient expressing frustration with complication development despite adherence. This is common and warrants empathetic engagement. No features of clinical depression on screening.

### Plan
1. Continue current medications unchanged — metformin 500 mg BID, empagliflozin 10 mg daily, ramipril 10 mg daily, rosuvastatin 10 mg daily
2. A1c target: maintain <= 7.0%. If A1c drifts above 7.0% at next check, will consider intensification — options include increasing metformin to 1000 mg BID or adding a GLP-1 receptor agonist. Endocrinology referral may be appropriate if A1c rises despite current regimen.
3. Nephrology virtual follow-up due approximately August 2025 — will ensure requisition is sent for pre-appointment labs
4. Ophthalmology follow-up: March 2026 — patient to keep
5. PHQ-2 screening: negative today, but will rescreen at subsequent visits
6. Validated patient's efforts and achievements — 2.6 kg weight loss, A1c from 7.4% to 7.0%, improved ACR, well-controlled BP. These are meaningful accomplishments.
7. Discussed the role of holistic health in chronic disease management — patient noted she has been attending a weekly sharing circle at the Indian Friendship Centre, which she finds grounding

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 3 months (July 2025) for A1c recheck; will also review nephrology pre-appointment labs
- Referrals: None at this time; potential endocrinology referral if A1c worsens

## Encounter 8: 2025-07-22 — Endocrinology Consultation — A1c Not at Target

- Date: 2025-07-22
- Time: 14:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Specialist Clinic (Virtual — OTN video visit)
- Organization: Grand River Hospital — Endocrine Clinic
- Practitioner: Dr. Jennifer Lam, MD FRCPC (ON-PRAC-76541)
- Reason for visit: Endocrinology consultation for type 2 diabetes with A1c above target despite dual oral therapy; referral from Dr. Anita Chakraborty

### Subjective
Ms. George is seen via OTN video consultation. She was referred by Dr. Chakraborty after her A1c rose to 7.4% on repeat bloodwork drawn July 2025, up from 7.0% in April 2025. She reports she has been adherent to metformin 500 mg BID and empagliflozin 10 mg daily. She also takes ramipril 10 mg daily and rosuvastatin 10 mg daily.

She reports that over the past 3 months, her diet has been less consistent. Her workplace schedule changed to include more evening and overnight shifts, which has disrupted her meal patterns and exercise routine. She gained approximately 1.5 kg. She has been eating more convenience foods. She feels guilty about the setback. She denies new symptoms — no polyuria, polydipsia, visual changes, or hypoglycemia.

She reports her participation in the diabetes wellness group at the Indian Friendship Centre has been sporadic due to the schedule change. She values the group and hopes to return to regular attendance when her schedule stabilizes in the fall.

She was last seen by nephrology in August 2024 (virtual) and has a follow-up scheduled for September 2025.

Background reviewed from referral documentation: 56-year-old First Nations woman with type 2 diabetes (diagnosed approximately 10 years ago), early diabetic kidney disease (CKD G2 A2), mild NPDR bilateral, hypertension, BMI approximately 30.

### Objective
- Virtual exam
- Vitals (obtained at FHT telehealth suite): BP 134/80 mmHg, HR 74 bpm, Weight 79.2 kg
- Labs (drawn 2025-07-15):
  - A1c: 7.4%
  - Fasting glucose: 8.6 mmol/L
  - Creatinine: 77 umol/L
  - eGFR: 83 mL/min/1.73m2
  - Urine ACR: 4.1 mg/mmol (slight uptick from 3.8 in January; still in A2 range)
  - Fasting lipid panel: LDL 1.9 mmol/L (improved on rosuvastatin), HDL 1.4 mmol/L, TG 1.6 mmol/L

### Assessment
1. **Type 2 diabetes mellitus — A1c above target at 7.4%** — Despite dual oral therapy (metformin + SGLT2i), glycemic control has deteriorated, likely driven by lifestyle disruption from shift work changes. This is a common and understandable pattern. Current metformin dose (500 mg BID = 1000 mg daily) is submaximal — can be increased. Additionally, given confirmed microvascular complications (NPDR + CKD), there is strong indication for a GLP-1 receptor agonist, which provides glycemic benefit, weight reduction, and cardiovascular/renal protection.
2. **Early diabetic kidney disease — CKD G2 A2** — Stable. SGLT2i in place. ACR slightly up but within A2 range.
3. **Mild NPDR, bilateral** — Stable per last ophthalmology visit (March 2025).
4. **Dyslipidemia** — LDL 1.9 on rosuvastatin; at target.
5. **Shift work and lifestyle disruption** — Significant modifiable factor affecting glycemic control.

### Plan
1. **Increase metformin to 850 mg BID** (uptitrated from 500 mg BID) — discuss GI tolerance; take with meals. Maximum dose 1000 mg BID could be targeted if tolerated.
2. **Initiate semaglutide (Ozempic) subcutaneous injection** — Start at 0.25 mg SC weekly for 4 weeks, then increase to 0.5 mg SC weekly. Target dose 1.0 mg SC weekly if tolerated. Discussed injection technique, GI side effects (nausea most common, usually transient), and storage. NIHB coverage confirmed for semaglutide with appropriate Special Authorization (SA) for type 2 diabetes with inadequate control on dual oral therapy and established microvascular complications.
3. Continue empagliflozin 10 mg daily
4. Continue ramipril 10 mg daily
5. Continue rosuvastatin 10 mg daily
6. Target A1c < 7.0% — expected improvement with metformin uptitration + semaglutide addition
7. Counselled on shift work diabetes management strategies: meal prepping, maintaining regular meal timing even on irregular shifts, portable healthy snacks, and maintaining physical activity. Provided educational resources.
8. Acknowledged the difficulty of managing chronic disease during work schedule disruptions — normalized the experience, provided encouragement
9. Discussed that semaglutide may help with weight management (average 3–5 kg loss at therapeutic dose), which aligns with patient's goals
10. Follow-up with endocrinology in 4–6 months to assess response to semaglutide
11. Consultation report and prescriptions communicated to Dr. Chakraborty

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 4–6 months with endocrinology (December 2025/January 2026, virtual)
- Referrals: Consultation report to Dr. Chakraborty; semaglutide Special Authorization submitted to NIHB

## Encounter 9: 2025-10-07 — NP Follow-up — Medication Adjustment Monitoring

- Date: 2025-10-07
- Time: 15:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team (Virtual — OTN video visit)
- Organization: Sudbury-Manitoulin Family Health Team, 865 Regent St, Suite 210, Sudbury, ON
- Practitioner: NP Derek Lapointe, MN NP-PHC (ON-NP-51087)
- Reason for visit: Monitoring response to semaglutide initiation and metformin uptitration; ongoing diabetes, CKD, and hypertension management

### Subjective
Ms. George is seen via OTN video from home for follow-up approximately 10 weeks after starting semaglutide. She reports that the NIHB Special Authorization for semaglutide was approved after a 3-week processing delay. She started semaglutide 0.25 mg SC weekly in mid-August, uptitrated to 0.5 mg SC weekly after 4 weeks, and has been on 0.5 mg for approximately 6 weeks. She experienced mild nausea during the first 2 weeks at each dose level, which resolved. She has had no vomiting, diarrhea, or injection site reactions. She is comfortable with self-injection technique.

She also tolerated the metformin increase to 850 mg BID without significant GI issues (mild bloating in the first week, now resolved).

She reports decreased appetite on semaglutide — she is eating smaller portions without feeling deprived. Her work schedule has stabilized, and she has resumed regular walking (30 minutes daily, 5–6 days per week). She returned to the diabetes wellness group at the Indian Friendship Centre in September and has attended three sessions.

She is optimistic about her trajectory. No hypoglycemia, no visual changes, no urinary symptoms.

She saw nephrology (Dr. Al-Rashid) via OTN on September 15, 2025 — the nephrologist was satisfied with stable renal function and improving ACR, and recommended continuing current renal-protective medications. Follow-up in 12 months.

### Objective
- Virtual visit
- Patient-reported vitals: BP 124/74 mmHg (home monitor average), HR 68 bpm
- Patient-reported weight: 76.4 kg (down from 79.2 kg in July — 2.8 kg loss over approximately 10 weeks)
- Labs (drawn 2025-09-30):
  - A1c: 7.0% (down from 7.4% in July)
  - Fasting glucose: 7.2 mmol/L
  - Creatinine: 76 umol/L
  - eGFR: 84 mL/min/1.73m2
  - Urine ACR: 3.5 mg/mmol (improved)
  - ALT: 20 U/L, CK: 88 U/L (statin monitoring — normal)
  - Electrolytes: within normal limits

### Assessment
1. **Type 2 diabetes mellitus** — A1c improved to 7.0% from 7.4% in July, after approximately 10 weeks of semaglutide 0.5 mg weekly and metformin 850 mg BID. Semaglutide is still being uptitrated — further A1c improvement expected when reaching 1.0 mg weekly. Weight trending down (total loss 3.7 kg from baseline in March 2024).
2. **Early diabetic kidney disease — CKD G2 A2** — eGFR stable at 84, ACR improved to 3.5 mg/mmol. Nephrology satisfied with trajectory. SGLT2i and RAAS blockade ongoing.
3. **Mild NPDR, bilateral** — Stable. Next ophthalmology appointment March 2026.
4. **Essential hypertension** — Excellent control at 124/74.
5. **Dyslipidemia** — Statin well-tolerated, labs normal.
6. **Psychosocial** — Patient re-engaged with Indigenous wellness supports and feeling optimistic. Positive trajectory.

### Plan
1. Uptitrate semaglutide to 1.0 mg SC weekly, starting next week — patient to continue for at least 8 weeks before reassessment. Discussed potential for transient GI side effects at higher dose. If 1.0 mg is not tolerated, may remain at 0.5 mg.
2. Continue metformin 850 mg BID — may increase to 1000 mg BID at next visit if A1c remains above 7.0% after semaglutide uptitration
3. Continue empagliflozin 10 mg daily
4. Continue ramipril 10 mg daily
5. Continue rosuvastatin 10 mg daily
6. Repeat A1c, renal function, and urine ACR in 3–4 months (January/February 2026), aligned with annual physical
7. Annual physical with Dr. Chakraborty due in February/March 2026 — will coordinate comprehensive assessment
8. Nephrology follow-up: September 2026 (virtual)
9. Ophthalmology follow-up: March 2026
10. Flu and COVID-19 boosters — due for this season. Recommended and offered at next in-person visit or at local pharmacy in Sault Ste. Marie

### Disposition
- Follow-up: February 2026 for annual physical with Dr. Chakraborty (in-person or virtual)
- Referrals: None new

## Encounter 10: 2026-02-10 — Annual Physical / Comprehensive Diabetes Review

- Date: 2026-02-10
- Time: 10:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Sudbury-Manitoulin Family Health Team, 865 Regent St, Suite 210, Sudbury, ON
- Practitioner: Dr. Anita Chakraborty, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-68390)
- Reason for visit: Annual health examination; comprehensive diabetes, CKD, and hypertension review; 2-year care trajectory assessment

### Subjective
Ms. George presents in person for her annual physical examination. She drove from Sault Ste. Marie this morning. She reports feeling the best she has in several years. She has been on semaglutide 1.0 mg SC weekly since mid-November 2025, having uptitrated from 0.5 mg. She experienced mild nausea for the first week at 1.0 mg, which resolved. She continues metformin 850 mg BID, empagliflozin 10 mg daily, ramipril 10 mg daily, and rosuvastatin 10 mg daily without side effects.

She reports her appetite is well-controlled on semaglutide. She is eating regular, balanced meals. She walks 30–40 minutes daily and has started attending a water aerobics class once weekly at the community pool. Her work schedule has remained stable. She continues to attend the diabetes wellness group at the Indian Friendship Centre biweekly and has become a peer mentor for newly diagnosed members.

She denies polyuria, polydipsia, visual changes, chest pain, dyspnea, numbness, tingling, or foot problems. She has been monitoring her blood pressure at home — readings generally 120–130/70–78. She has not had any hypoglycemic episodes.

She reports her mood has been good. She has a strong support network through family and the Friendship Centre. She denies symptoms of depression or anxiety. She received her flu and COVID-19 boosters in November 2025 at a pharmacy in Sault Ste. Marie.

She asks whether she can eventually reduce any of her medications. She also asks about the ophthalmology follow-up — she received a letter confirming her appointment for March 2026 and plans to keep it.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 126/74 mmHg (seated, left arm), HR 66 bpm regular, RR 14, Temp 36.5 C, SpO2 99% RA
- Height: 162 cm
- Weight: 74.6 kg (down from 80.1 kg at baseline March 2024 — total loss 5.5 kg over approximately 23 months)
- BMI: 28.4 kg/m2 (improved from 30.5)
- General: Well-appearing, good affect, comfortable
- HEENT: Pupils equal and reactive, oropharynx clear, no thyromegaly
- CVS: S1 S2 normal, no murmurs, no peripheral edema
- Resp: Clear bilaterally
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly
- Feet: Skin intact bilaterally, no calluses, no ulceration. Pedal pulses 2+ bilaterally. Monofilament testing: intact sensation at 9/10 sites bilaterally (improved from 8/10 in March 2024; previously diminished 5th metatarsal sites now intact on right, borderline on left)
- Labs (drawn 2026-02-03):
  - A1c: 6.6% (down from 7.4% at baseline)
  - Fasting glucose: 6.4 mmol/L
  - Creatinine: 74 umol/L
  - eGFR: 87 mL/min/1.73m2 (stable/improved)
  - Urine ACR: 2.8 mg/mmol (improved; approaching normal range)
  - Fasting lipid panel: Total cholesterol 3.8 mmol/L, LDL 1.7 mmol/L, HDL 1.5 mmol/L, TG 1.3 mmol/L
  - TSH: 1.9 mIU/L (normal)
  - ALT: 18 U/L, CK: 82 U/L (normal)
  - CBC: within normal limits
  - Electrolytes: within normal limits

### Assessment
1. **Type 2 diabetes mellitus — A1c 6.6%, well below target** — Remarkable improvement from 7.4% at initial assessment in March 2024. Current regimen of metformin 850 mg BID, empagliflozin 10 mg daily, and semaglutide 1.0 mg weekly is highly effective. Weight loss of 5.5 kg (6.9% of initial weight) contributing meaningfully.
2. **Diabetic kidney disease — CKD G2, albuminuria improving** — eGFR 87 (stable), urine ACR 2.8 mg/mmol (near-normal; down from peak of 5.4 in August 2024). The combination of SGLT2i, RAAS blockade, glycemic optimization, and BP control has achieved near-remission of albuminuria. This is an excellent outcome. Nephrology follow-up due September 2026.
3. **Mild NPDR, bilateral** — Ophthalmology follow-up confirmed for March 2026. Improved glycemic control is the most important factor in slowing progression.
4. **Essential hypertension — well-controlled** — BP 126/74 on ramipril 10 mg. No medication change needed.
5. **Dyslipidemia — at target** — LDL 1.7 on rosuvastatin 10 mg. Well-tolerated.
6. **Peripheral neuropathy screening** — Monofilament testing improved to 9/10 bilaterally (from 8/10). While peripheral neuropathy may not fully reverse, improved glycemic control can halt progression and lead to partial improvement. Encouraging finding.
7. **BMI 28.4** — Now in the overweight range, down from obese (30.5). Continued weight loss may be possible on current regimen.
8. **Psychosocial well-being** — Patient engaged, empowered, and connected with Indigenous community health supports. Now serving as peer mentor — strong indicator of self-efficacy.

### Plan
1. Continue current medications unchanged:
   - Metformin 850 mg BID
   - Empagliflozin 10 mg daily
   - Semaglutide 1.0 mg SC weekly
   - Ramipril 10 mg daily
   - Rosuvastatin 10 mg daily
2. Regarding medication reduction question: Discussed with patient that while her results are excellent, the current medications are each serving a specific purpose (glycemic control, renoprotection, BP control, cardiovascular risk reduction). Discontinuation of any agent could lead to regression of the improvements achieved. Recommend maintaining current regimen and reassessing annually. If A1c remains well below target (e.g., < 6.5%) for a sustained period and albuminuria resolves, could consider cautious reduction of metformin in the future. However, SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA provide benefits beyond glycemic control and should be continued.
3. Repeat A1c, renal function, urine ACR, and lipids in 6 months (August 2026)
4. Ophthalmology follow-up: March 2026 — patient to keep appointment with Dr. Liu
5. Nephrology follow-up: September 2026 (virtual via OTN with Dr. Al-Rashid)
6. Endocrinology follow-up: Will send updated A1c and weight trend to Dr. Lam; given current excellent control, next endocrinology visit can be deferred to 12 months unless issues arise
7. Annual foot exam completed today — next in 12 months. Podiatry referral not required at this time given intact skin and improving sensation.
8. Vaccinations: flu and COVID-19 boosters — up to date. Pneumococcal vaccine due (age-appropriate, diabetes); administered today (Prevnar 20).
9. Cancer screening: cervical screening due — Pap test performed today. Mammography — up to date (last screening November 2025). Colorectal screening — FIT test to be provided for home completion.
10. Continue engagement with Indian Friendship Centre diabetes wellness group and peer mentorship role
11. Explored potential for some FHT visits to be conducted through the Sault Ste. Marie Group Health Centre via shared-care arrangement to reduce travel burden — Dr. Chakraborty will explore this option with FHT administration
12. Next annual physical: February 2027

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 6 months for A1c and renal function (August 2026); annual physical February 2027
- Referrals: None new; existing specialist follow-ups in place (Ophthalmology March 2026, Nephrology September 2026)
