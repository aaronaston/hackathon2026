### Subjective
Mrs. DiMarco presents for her annual physical. She reports feeling well overall. She has been adherent to pantoprazole 20 mg daily and calcium carbonate 500 mg with vitamin D3 1000 IU daily. She denies dysphagia, odynophagia, heartburn, or regurgitation — her GERD symptoms have been well controlled on pantoprazole. She has no abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, melena, or hematochezia. She denies any bone pain, loss of height, or history of fragility fractures. She has not had a fall in the past year. She remains active and walks three to four times per week with her community walking group, typically 30 to 45 minutes per session. She retired from administrative work approximately three years ago. She denies low mood, sleep disturbance, or cognitive concerns. No urinary symptoms. She lives independently with her husband. Non-smoker, never smoked. Alcohol use rare, approximately one glass of wine per month. No recent travel. She has a documented sulfa allergy manifesting as a diffuse macular rash; this was confirmed in her early 40s with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Family history: Mother had osteoporosis with a hip fracture at age 78. Father had coronary artery disease, died at age 74. No family history of GI malignancy.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 126/74 mmHg (seated, right arm), HR 68 bpm regular, RR 14, Temp 36.5 C, SpO2 98% RA

- Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly, bowel sounds normal
- Musculoskeletal: No kyphosis, no vertebral tenderness, gait steady
- Skin: No suspicious lesions
- Labs (fasting, drawn 2024-04-09):
  - CBC: Hemoglobin 132 g/L, WBC 6.2, Platelets 244
  - Creatinine: 68 umol/L, eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73m2
  - Fasting glucose: 5.1 mmol/L
  - HbA1c: 5.4%

  - 25-OH vitamin D: 82 nmol/L (adequate on supplementation)
  - Magnesium: 0.82 mmol/L (normal)
  - ALT: 22 U/L, ALP: 68 U/L

### Assessment
1. **Osteopenia** — Diagnosed on DEXA 2022 (lumbar spine T-score -1.8, femoral neck T-score -1.6). No fragility fractures. Height stable. Maternal history of osteoporosis is a risk factor. Currently supplementing calcium and vitamin D; levels adequate. DEXA interval follow-up warranted — last scan was approximately two years ago. Notably, long-term PPI use has been associated with modest increase in fracture risk, which is relevant in the context of her osteopenia.
2. **GERD** — Well controlled on pantoprazole 20 mg daily. No alarm features. She has been on a PPI for approximately 4 years. Should discuss long-term PPI risks including potential bone density effects, hypomagnesemia, and Clostridioides difficile risk. Magnesium level is normal today.
3. **Cardiovascular risk** — Framingham risk score estimated moderate given age. LDL 3.0 mmol/L. Not currently on statin. Warrants discussion at next visit or when DEXA results reviewed.
4. **Preventive care** — Colonoscopy 2022 was normal (no polyps); next screening due approximately 2032 per ColonCancerCheck. Mammography due (last performed 2022). Influenza and COVID-19 vaccines up to date. Pneumococcal vaccine (Prevnar 20) recommended given age > 65; not yet received.

### Plan
1. Continue pantoprazole 20 mg daily. Discussed long-term PPI considerations briefly; will review in detail at next visit after DEXA results available.
2. Continue calcium carbonate 500 mg / vitamin D3 1000 IU daily.
3. Requisition for DEXA scan — to be performed at Niagara Specialist Centre. Last DEXA was April 2022.
4. Requisition for screening mammography.
5. Recommended Prevnar 20 (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) — patient agreeable. Administered today, left deltoid. Lot #P20-44821, exp 2025-06.
6. Reinforce weight-bearing exercise; patient already active with walking group — encouraged to continue.
7. Fall risk assessment: negative today; no interventions required.
8. Repeat labs in 12 months or sooner if clinically indicated.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 4 months (August 2024), post-DEXA to review bone density results
- Referrals: DEXA scan — Niagara Specialist Centre, St. Catharines

---

## Encounter 2: 2024-08-20 — DEXA Follow-up / Bone Health Review

- Date: 2024-08-20
- Time: 14:15
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team, 690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton, ON
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Review DEXA scan results; bone health management; long-term PPI risk discussion

### Subjective
Mrs. DiMarco returns for follow-up to review her DEXA scan results. She reports feeling well. No falls, fractures, or bone pain since last visit. She continues walking regularly with her group and has added some light resistance band exercises as previously discussed with a friend. She remains adherent to pantoprazole 20 mg daily and calcium/vitamin D. GERD symptoms remain well controlled. She received her screening mammogram in June — she was told the results were normal. She asks about whether she should still be taking pantoprazole long-term and mentions she read an article about PPIs and bone health.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 122/72 mmHg, HR 66 bpm, Weight: 63.5 kg (stable)
- General: Well, no acute distress
- Musculoskeletal: No vertebral tenderness, no kyphosis, steady gait
- DEXA scan results (performed 2024-07-11 at Niagara Specialist Centre):
  - Lumbar spine (L1-L4) BMD: 0.892 g/cm2, T-score -1.9 (osteopenia; prior -1.8 in 2022)
  - Femoral neck BMD: 0.718 g/cm2, T-score -1.7 (osteopenia; prior -1.6 in 2022)
  - Total hip BMD: 0.834 g/cm2, T-score -1.2 (within expected range)
  - Interpretation: Osteopenia, stable to mildly progressed. No T-score in the osteoporotic range (< -2.5).
- FRAX 10-year fracture probability (calculated without BMD input, Canadian model):
  - Major osteoporotic fracture: 14%
  - Hip fracture: 3.2%
- Mammography (2024-06-18): BI-RADS 1, negative. Routine screening in 2 years.

### Assessment
1. **Osteopenia — mildly progressed** — DEXA shows a small decline at both lumbar spine and femoral neck (approximately 0.1 T-score unit at each site over 2 years). This is within the range of measurement variability but given direction of trend and concurrent PPI use, warrants attention. FRAX risk is below the pharmacologic treatment threshold (Osteoporosis Canada recommends treatment when 10-year major fracture risk >= 20% or hip fracture risk >= 3%). Her hip fracture risk at 3.2% is borderline. No indication for bisphosphonate therapy at this time, but close monitoring warranted.
2. **Long-term PPI use and bone health** — Pantoprazole has been used for approximately 4 years. Evidence suggests a modest increase in fracture risk with prolonged PPI use, possibly via impaired calcium absorption. Given osteopenia with mild progression, it is reasonable to attempt a PPI step-down trial. GERD symptoms are well controlled and she has no Barrett's esophagus or erosive esophagitis requiring maintenance therapy.
3. **Mammography** — Normal. Next due 2026.

### Plan
1. Discussed DEXA results and FRAX in detail. Patient understands she is in the osteopenia range and not yet osteoporotic. Emphasized importance of modifiable risk factors.
2. PPI step-down trial: Reduce pantoprazole from 20 mg daily to 20 mg every other day for 4 weeks, then attempt discontinuation. If GERD symptoms recur, use pantoprazole on-demand (PRN) rather than continuously. Provided anticipatory guidance regarding potential rebound acid hypersecretion in the first 2 to 4 weeks after discontinuation.
3. If PPI cannot be discontinued, consider switching to an H2 receptor antagonist (famotidine 20 mg at bedtime) for maintenance.
4. Continue calcium carbonate 500 mg / vitamin D3 1000 IU daily. Discussed increasing dietary calcium through dairy and fortified foods.
5. Encouraged continued weight-bearing exercise and resistance training. Provided Osteoporosis Canada exercise handout.
6. Repeat DEXA in 2 years (mid-2026) to assess trajectory.
7. Repeat 25-OH vitamin D and magnesium at next annual bloodwork.
8. No indication for bisphosphonate therapy at this time. Will reassess if further decline on next DEXA or if fragility fracture occurs.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 3-4 months to reassess GERD symptoms after PPI step-down trial
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 3: 2024-12-10 — Walk-in for Acute GI Symptoms

- Date: 2024-12-10
- Time: 11:45
- Type: Walk-in
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team, 690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton, ON
- Practitioner: NP Sandra Fleming, NP-PHC (Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team)
- Reason for visit: Acute-onset epigastric pain, nausea, and heartburn for 3 days

### Subjective
Mrs. DiMarco presents on a walk-in basis with a 3-day history of epigastric burning, intermittent nausea, and acid reflux. She reports the symptoms began after she successfully tapered off pantoprazole approximately 6 weeks ago, per the plan discussed with Dr. Moreau in August. She initially managed without any acid suppression but over the past 3 days, symptoms have worsened significantly. She describes the pain as a substernal burning sensation, worse after meals and when lying down. She used over-the-counter calcium carbonate antacid tablets (Tums) with only partial relief. No dysphagia, odynophagia, vomiting, hematemesis, or melena. No chest pain on exertion, no diaphoresis. Bowel movements unchanged. No fevers. She has not taken any NSAIDs. She is concerned because she was hoping to stay off the pantoprazole for bone health reasons.

Allergies confirmed: Sulfa (rash).

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 130/76 mmHg, HR 72 bpm, RR 15, Temp 36.5 C, SpO2 98% RA
- Weight: 64.2 kg
- General: Mildly uncomfortable, no acute distress
- Abdomen: Soft, mild epigastric tenderness without guarding or rebound, no organomegaly, bowel sounds normal
- Cardiovascular: S1 S2 normal, no murmurs (cardiac cause of chest discomfort considered unlikely given history and context)
- No peripheral edema

### Assessment
1. **GERD exacerbation — likely rebound acid hypersecretion** — Symptoms are consistent with GERD flare following PPI discontinuation. Rebound hypersecretion is a recognized phenomenon after prolonged PPI use, typically occurring within 2 to 8 weeks of stopping. No alarm features (dysphagia, weight loss, hematemesis, anemia). Age-appropriate cancer screening is up to date.
2. **Osteopenia** — Ongoing management consideration in the context of acid suppression decisions.

### Plan
1. Restart acid suppression at a lower intensity: Start famotidine 20 mg PO twice daily (morning and bedtime) as an alternative to PPI, given bone health concerns.
2. Lifestyle measures reinforced: avoid eating within 3 hours of bedtime, elevate head of bed, limit caffeine and acidic foods, maintain healthy weight.
3. Use calcium carbonate antacid tablets PRN for breakthrough symptoms during the transition.
4. If symptoms do not improve within 2 to 3 weeks on famotidine, may need to resume pantoprazole 20 mg daily at the lowest effective dose.
5. No indication for urgent endoscopy — no alarm features, patient is under age 80, and prior colonoscopy (2022) was normal (note: colonoscopy and upper endoscopy are different investigations; upper endoscopy would be considered if alarm features develop or symptoms are refractory).
6. Discussed findings and plan with Dr. Moreau via secure internal message.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 4 weeks with Dr. Moreau for reassessment; sooner if symptoms worsen or alarm features develop
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 4: 2025-04-08 — GERD Management / Long-term PPI Risk Discussion

- Date: 2025-04-08
- Time: 09:45
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team, 690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton, ON
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: GERD management follow-up; long-term acid suppression strategy; medication review

### Subjective
Mrs. DiMarco returns for scheduled follow-up. She reports that after restarting famotidine 20 mg twice daily in December 2024, her symptoms improved substantially within the first 2 weeks. She has had occasional mild heartburn, perhaps once every 2 weeks, managed with a calcium carbonate antacid. She has not needed to resume pantoprazole. She is pleased with the current regimen and feels her reflux is adequately controlled. She denies dysphagia, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, or change in bowel habits. She has been walking regularly and started attending a weekly gentle yoga class. Sleep is good. Mood is well. No falls. She asks whether she can stay on famotidine long-term and whether there is any concern about it and her bones.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 124/70 mmHg, HR 64 bpm, RR 14, Temp 36.5 C, SpO2 99% RA
- Weight: 63.6 kg, Height: 159 cm, BMI: 25.2
- General: Well-appearing, in no distress
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly
- Musculoskeletal: No new kyphosis, no vertebral tenderness
- Labs (fasting, drawn 2025-03-31):
  - Calcium (corrected): 2.36 mmol/L (normal)
  - 25-OH vitamin D: 76 nmol/L (adequate)
  - Magnesium: 0.84 mmol/L (normal)
  - Creatinine: 70 umol/L, eGFR > 60
  - CBC: Hemoglobin 130 g/L, within normal limits
  - Ferritin: 48 ug/L (normal; monitored given change in acid suppression — H2RAs may slightly reduce iron absorption)
  - B12: 302 pmol/L (normal; monitored given prior long-term PPI use)

### Assessment
1. **GERD — well controlled on H2RA** — Successful transition from pantoprazole to famotidine. Symptoms are minimal and managed with PRN antacids. H2 receptor antagonists have not been associated with the same degree of fracture risk as PPIs in observational studies. Reasonable to continue famotidine long-term at current dose.
2. **Osteopenia** — Stable clinically. No fragility fractures. Active with weight-bearing exercise and resistance activities. Calcium and vitamin D levels adequate. DEXA planned for mid-2026. PPI discontinuation removes one modifiable risk factor.
3. **Nutritional monitoring post-PPI** — B12 and ferritin are normal. Magnesium normal. No evidence of malabsorption.
4. **Cardiovascular risk** — LDL was 3.0 mmol/L last year. Patient is 67 with moderate Framingham risk. Revisited statin discussion. Patient remains interested in lifestyle approach. Will reassess with next lipid panel.

### Plan
1. Continue famotidine 20 mg PO twice daily.
2. Discontinue pantoprazole — formally removed from active medication list.
3. Continue calcium carbonate 500 mg / vitamin D3 1000 IU daily.
4. PRN calcium carbonate antacid tablets for occasional breakthrough heartburn.
5. Continue weight-bearing exercise and yoga — encouraged.
6. Repeat lipid panel at next annual bloodwork (fall 2025). Reassess statin discussion at that time.
7. Annual bloodwork requisition to be provided at September annual physical.
8. DEXA scan to be arranged in mid-2026 (approximately 2 years from prior scan).
9. Influenza vaccine due in the fall.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 5 months (September 2025) for annual physical
- Referrals: None
