## Encounter 1: 2024-04-16 — Anxiety Follow-up / Medication Review

- Date: 2024-04-16
- Time: 10:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Follow-up for generalized anxiety disorder and medication review

### Subjective
Ms. Khan presents for a scheduled follow-up of her generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), diagnosed approximately two years ago. She was started on Sertraline 50 mg daily at that time and has been maintained on this dose since. She reports feeling "mostly okay" but notes persistent low-grade worry, particularly related to work deadlines and finances since relocating from Hamilton to Collingwood approximately six months ago. She finds the commute and distance from her support network somewhat isolating, though she has been maintaining regular virtual visits with this clinic.

She reports her sleep has been variable — she typically takes 30–45 minutes to fall asleep and wakes once during the night, though she is generally able to return to sleep. She estimates 6–6.5 hours of sleep per night on average. She denies panic attacks, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, or trauma-related symptoms. Appetite is good. She is functioning well at work as a graphic designer (remote/freelance). She exercises intermittently — yoga once or twice per week and occasional walks. She has not engaged in formal counselling or cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) but has used self-guided mindfulness apps.

No suicidal ideation, self-harm, or psychotic symptoms. No side effects from Sertraline — no gastrointestinal symptoms, sexual dysfunction, or weight changes that she has noticed.

Past medical history: Generalized anxiety disorder (diagnosed 2022). No surgical history. No other medical conditions.

Medications: Sertraline 50 mg PO daily.

Allergies: No known drug allergies. No food or environmental allergies.

Social history: Non-smoker. Occasional alcohol (1–2 drinks per week, socially). No recreational drug use. Lives alone in Collingwood, ON. Works from home as a freelance graphic designer. Single, no dependents. Family (parents, one sibling) in Hamilton.

Family history: Mother with depression (managed with medication). Father healthy. No family history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or completed suicide.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 116/72 mmHg, HR 68 bpm, RR 14, Temp 36.5°C, SpO2 99% RA
- Height: 165 cm, Weight: 61.2 kg, BMI: 22.5 kg/m²
- General: Well-appearing, pleasant, cooperative. Mildly anxious affect but appropriate. Good eye contact. Speech normal rate and rhythm.
- Mental status: Alert and oriented. Mood described as "alright, a bit worried." Affect congruent, mildly anxious. Thought process linear and goal-directed. No thought disorder, no paranoia, no perceptual disturbances. Denies suicidal or homicidal ideation. Insight and judgment intact.

Screening tools:
- PHQ-9: 7/27 (mild depressive symptoms — items endorsed: sleep difficulty, fatigue, poor concentration)
- GAD-7: 10/21 (moderate anxiety — items endorsed: feeling anxious, uncontrollable worry, difficulty relaxing, restlessness)

### Assessment
1. Generalized anxiety disorder — moderate, partially treated. GAD-7 score 10 indicates moderate anxiety despite Sertraline 50 mg daily for approximately two years. PHQ-9 score 7 suggests mild comorbid depressive symptoms, likely related to the anxiety disorder rather than a separate major depressive episode. Patient is functioning reasonably well occupationally and socially, though with some impairment in sleep and concentration. She has not yet engaged in evidence-based psychotherapy (CBT), which is first-line adjunctive treatment for GAD.
2. Insomnia — likely anxiety-related. Sleep onset latency of 30–45 minutes and nocturnal awakening. Not meeting criteria for an independent insomnia disorder at this time.
3. Social adjustment post-relocation — contributing psychosocial stressor. Patient is relatively isolated in Collingwood, away from her support network.

### Plan
1. Continue Sertraline 50 mg PO daily. Discussed option of dose increase to 75 mg or 100 mg if symptoms remain inadequately controlled after psychotherapy trial. Patient prefers to attempt CBT before adjusting medication dose.
2. Referral for cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) — referred to a psychologist or therapist through the Ontario Structured Psychotherapy (OSP) program, which is OHIP-funded. Discussed that CBT is the gold-standard psychotherapy for GAD and that virtual sessions are available, which would suit her location in Collingwood. Approximate wait time 6–12 weeks.
3. Sleep hygiene counselling provided: consistent wake time, limiting screen exposure 1 hour before bed, avoiding caffeine after noon, relaxation techniques before sleep. Patient already using a mindfulness app, which was encouraged.
4. Encouraged regular physical activity — aim for 150 minutes per week of moderate exercise, which has evidence for reducing anxiety symptoms.
5. Discussed building local social connections in Collingwood to mitigate isolation.
6. PHQ-9 and GAD-7 to be repeated at next visit to track trajectory.
7. If anxiety worsens significantly or she develops panic attacks, depressive episodes, or suicidal ideation, she was advised to contact the clinic, present to the nearest ED, or call 988 (Suicide Crisis Helpline).

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 3–4 months (virtual visit preferred given distance) for GAD reassessment and CBT progress check
- Referrals: Ontario Structured Psychotherapy (OSP) program for CBT

## Encounter 2: 2024-08-07 — Walk-in Visit for Acute Respiratory Illness

- Date: 2024-08-07
- Time: 13:30
- Type: Walk-in
- Setting: Walk-in Clinic
- Organization: Barrie South Walk-in Clinic (45 Essa Rd, Barrie, ON)
- Practitioner: Dr. Alan Patterson, MD (ON-PRAC-71940)
- Reason for visit: Sore throat, cough, and nasal congestion × 4 days

### Subjective
Ms. Khan presents to the walk-in clinic with a 4-day history of sore throat, dry cough, nasal congestion, and mild generalized malaise. She reports the sore throat began first, followed by nasal congestion and cough. The cough is nonproductive. She has had mild low-grade chills but has not measured her temperature at home. No dyspnea, chest pain, wheezing, or hemoptysis. No ear pain, sinus pressure, or purulent nasal discharge. Appetite mildly reduced. She has been managing symptoms with acetaminophen 500 mg every 6 hours as needed and increased fluid intake.

She notes she attended a social gathering approximately one week ago and several attendees subsequently became ill. She is not aware of any confirmed COVID-19 or influenza exposures.

Past medical history: Generalized anxiety disorder, managed with Sertraline 50 mg daily. No other conditions. No allergies.

She does not have a family physician locally — her FP is Dr. Hannah Moreau at Hamilton Mountain FHT. She chose to visit the Barrie walk-in given proximity to Collingwood.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 118/74 mmHg, HR 76 bpm, RR 16, Temp 37.4°C (oral), SpO2 98% RA
- General: Mildly fatigued-appearing but in no acute distress
- HEENT: Oropharynx erythematous, no tonsillar exudates or enlargement. Bilateral tympanic membranes clear, no bulging or effusion. Nasal mucosa edematous and erythematous with clear discharge. No sinus tenderness on palpation.
- Neck: No anterior cervical lymphadenopathy. No neck stiffness.
- Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, crackles, or rhonchi. Good air entry throughout.
- Centor score: 1 (pharyngeal erythema without exudate, no fever ≥ 38°C, no tonsillar enlargement, no tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, age 30 — no points for age)

Point-of-care rapid COVID-19 antigen test: Negative.

### Assessment
1. Acute viral upper respiratory tract infection — clinical presentation is consistent with a common cold or other non-specific viral URTI. Low Centor score makes Group A Streptococcus pharyngitis unlikely; rapid strep testing not indicated. COVID-19 rapid antigen negative. No clinical features suggesting influenza (no high fever, myalgias, or abrupt onset). No lower respiratory tract involvement.

### Plan
1. Supportive management: Continue acetaminophen 500 mg PO every 4–6 hours as needed for sore throat and malaise (max 4 g/day). May alternate with Ibuprofen 400 mg PO every 6 hours as needed if additional relief required.
2. Saline nasal irrigation for congestion. Over-the-counter lozenges for throat comfort.
3. Adequate hydration and rest.
4. Antibiotics not indicated — viral etiology is most likely and Centor score does not support empiric antibiotic therapy.
5. If symptoms worsen (high fever > 38.5°C, dyspnea, chest pain, symptoms persisting beyond 10–14 days, or development of purulent nasal discharge suggesting secondary bacterial sinusitis), advised to return to the clinic or seek medical attention.
6. Continue Sertraline 50 mg daily as prescribed.
7. Visit note to be faxed to Dr. Hannah Moreau at Hamilton Mountain FHT for records.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: As needed if symptoms worsen or fail to resolve in 10–14 days; routine care with FP as scheduled
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 3: 2024-12-03 — GAD Follow-up / PHQ-9 and GAD-7 Reassessment (Virtual)

- Date: 2024-12-03
- Time: 14:15
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team (Virtual — Ontario Telemedicine Network / OTN video visit)
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Generalized anxiety disorder follow-up, screening tool reassessment, CBT progress review

### Subjective
Ms. Khan presents via virtual visit for her scheduled GAD follow-up. She was last seen in April 2024, at which time she was referred to the Ontario Structured Psychotherapy (OSP) program for CBT. She reports she was accepted into the program approximately two months after the referral and has now completed eight sessions of individual CBT, delivered virtually by a registered psychotherapist. She found the therapy "really helpful" and reports she has been using cognitive restructuring techniques to manage her worrying, particularly around work deadlines and finances. She has also been practising scheduled worry time, progressive muscle relaxation, and behavioural activation strategies.

She reports her overall anxiety is "noticeably better" compared to April. She is worrying less frequently and is better able to interrupt worry spirals. Her sleep has improved — she now falls asleep within 15–20 minutes most nights and wakes during the night only occasionally (once or twice per week rather than nightly). She estimates 7 hours of sleep per night. She has joined a local yoga studio in Collingwood and attends classes twice per week. She also walks regularly.

She continues to take Sertraline 50 mg daily without side effects. She does not feel a dose increase is necessary at this time given her improvement.

No panic attacks, no depressive episodes, no suicidal ideation. Appetite and energy are good. She is functioning well at work and has made several social connections in the Collingwood area.

She had an acute URTI in August, treated symptomatically at a Barrie walk-in (Dr. Patterson), which resolved completely.

### Objective
*Virtual visit — limited physical examination. Observations via video:*
- General: Well-appearing, pleasant, relaxed posture. Good eye contact. Speech normal rate and volume. Mood appears euthymic.
- Mental status: Alert and oriented. Mood described as "good — the best I've felt in a while." Affect bright, congruent, full range. Thought process linear, goal-directed. No psychomotor agitation or retardation. Denies suicidal or homicidal ideation, hallucinations, or delusions. Insight and judgment intact.

Screening tools (completed via electronic form prior to visit):
- PHQ-9: 4/27 (minimal depressive symptoms — down from 7 in April 2024)
- GAD-7: 6/21 (mild anxiety — down from 10 in April 2024)

### Assessment
1. Generalized anxiety disorder — improved. GAD-7 has decreased from 10 (moderate) to 6 (mild), representing clinically meaningful improvement. Patient has engaged well with CBT through the OSP program and is applying techniques effectively in daily life. PHQ-9 has improved from 7 to 4, with resolution of fatigue and concentration concerns. Sleep has also improved. Current Sertraline 50 mg dose appears adequate in combination with psychotherapy. No indication for dose change at this time.
2. Insomnia — resolved. Sleep latency improved to 15–20 minutes. Nocturnal awakenings reduced. Meeting estimated 7 hours per night, which is within normal range for her age.
3. Social adjustment — improved. Patient has integrated into the Collingwood community and is attending local yoga classes and building friendships.

### Plan
1. Continue Sertraline 50 mg PO daily. No dose adjustment indicated given improvement.
2. CBT — patient has completed 8 sessions through OSP. Encourage continued use of CBT skills (cognitive restructuring, relaxation techniques, behavioural activation). If additional sessions are desired, she may re-engage with the program or seek a private psychotherapist.
3. Continue regular physical activity (yoga, walking) and sleep hygiene practices.
4. PHQ-9 and GAD-7 will be repeated at next visit to confirm sustained improvement.
5. Discussed long-term medication plan: Sertraline should be continued for a minimum of 12–24 months after achieving remission. Given that she has been on the medication since 2022 and symptoms are now mild, a cautious taper could be considered in the future if remission is sustained. No plan to taper at this time.
6. Safety net: If anxiety worsens significantly, return of panic-like symptoms, or depressive episodes, patient to contact the clinic or present to local ED. Crisis resources reviewed (988 Suicide Crisis Helpline, local Simcoe-Muskoka crisis line).

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 5–6 months (at annual physical, approximately May 2025)
- Referrals: None new

- Date: 2025-05-13
- Time: 09:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Annual health examination

### Subjective
Ms. Khan presents in person for her annual physical examination. She reports feeling well overall. Her anxiety has been "manageable" and she continues to apply the CBT techniques she learned last year. She has not required additional psychotherapy sessions. She continues Sertraline 50 mg daily without side effects.

She has no new medical concerns. No chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, gastrointestinal symptoms, urinary symptoms, or musculoskeletal complaints. Menstrual cycles are regular, every 28–30 days, lasting 4–5 days, with normal flow. She is not currently sexually active and has no concerns regarding contraception. Last Pap test was 2022 — she is due for cervical screening.

She is eating well, maintaining regular exercise (yoga twice weekly, walking 3–4 times per week), and sleeping 7 hours per night. No change in weight. No new medications or supplements. She takes no over-the-counter medications regularly.

She occasionally has a glass of wine socially (1–2 per month). Non-smoker. No recreational drugs.

Immunizations: Influenza — received fall 2024. COVID-19 — last booster fall 2023, unsure if she is due for another. Tdap — uncertain of last dose.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 114/70 mmHg, HR 66 bpm, RR 14, Temp 36.5°C, SpO2 99% RA
- Height: 165 cm, Weight: 61.2 kg, BMI: 22.5 kg/m²
- General: Well-appearing, no acute distress, relaxed demeanor
- HEENT: Pupils equal and reactive, oropharynx clear, no thyromegaly, no cervical lymphadenopathy
- Cardiovascular: S1 S2 normal, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs. Peripheral pulses 2+ bilaterally.
- Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, no organomegaly, bowel sounds normal
- Breast examination: No masses, no axillary lymphadenopathy bilaterally
- Skin: No concerning lesions. No rashes.
- Mental status: Euthymic, affect bright and congruent. No psychomotor abnormalities. Thought process linear. Denies SI/HI.

Screening tools (completed in office):
- PHQ-9: 3/27 (minimal — stable/improved from 4 in December 2024)
- GAD-7: 5/21 (mild — improved from 6 in December 2024)

Cervical screening: Pap test collected today. Results to follow.

Lab results (drawn 2025-05-06, routine annual):
- CBC: within normal limits (Hgb 134 g/L, WBC 6.2, Plt 248)
- Creatinine: 62 µmol/L, eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73m²
- Fasting glucose: 4.8 mmol/L
- TSH: 1.9 mIU/L
- Fasting lipid panel: Total cholesterol 4.2 mmol/L, LDL 2.3 mmol/L, HDL 1.6 mmol/L, TG 0.7 mmol/L
- Ferritin: 48 µg/L (normal)

### Assessment
1. Generalized anxiety disorder — in partial remission. GAD-7 score 5 (mild), PHQ-9 score 3 (minimal). This represents a sustained downward trend from the moderate range in early 2024. Patient is functioning well, sleeping well, and applying CBT skills independently. Current Sertraline 50 mg dose remains appropriate.
2. Health maintenance — age 30 female:
   - Cervical screening: Pap test done today (due per Ontario guidelines, previous Pap 2022). Results pending.
   - Breast screening: Not yet indicated per Ontario guidelines (screening mammography begins at age 50, or earlier if high-risk).
   - Immunizations: Influenza — recommended for fall 2025. COVID-19 — advised to check eligibility for 2025 booster per current NACI guidance. Tdap — patient uncertain of last dose; if > 10 years, booster recommended.
3. Metabolic screening — all within normal limits. Fasting glucose, lipids, TSH, renal function, CBC, and ferritin unremarkable. No risk factors for diabetes. Lipid panel favorable. BMI 22.5 (normal range).
4. No new medical issues identified.

### Plan
1. Continue Sertraline 50 mg PO daily. Discussed that given sustained improvement, could consider a gradual taper in 6–12 months if remission is maintained. No pressure to taper — some patients prefer indefinite maintenance, particularly with a family history of mood disorder. Patient wishes to "keep things stable for now," which is reasonable.
2. Continue independent CBT skills practice. If anxiety flares, she may re-engage with the OSP program or seek private therapy.
3. Pap test results to be communicated by telephone or secure message within 4–6 weeks. If abnormal, patient will be contacted for follow-up.
4. Immunizations: Tdap booster administered today (patient could not confirm receipt in adulthood). Influenza vaccine — advised for fall 2025. COVID-19 booster — patient to check pharmacy for current eligibility.
5. Continue regular exercise and healthy lifestyle practices.
6. Repeat PHQ-9 and GAD-7 at next scheduled anxiety follow-up.
7. Annual bloodwork — no abnormalities requiring follow-up.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 5–6 months for anxiety reassessment and medication review (approximately October–November 2025); or sooner if concerns arise
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 5: 2025-10-21 — Medication Renewal / Anxiety Stable (Virtual)

- Date: 2025-10-21
- Time: 11:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team (Virtual — OTN video visit)
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Sertraline prescription renewal and anxiety follow-up

### Subjective
Ms. Khan presents via virtual visit for her routine anxiety follow-up and Sertraline prescription renewal. She reports she has been doing well. Anxiety remains "mild and manageable." She continues to use cognitive restructuring and relaxation techniques from her CBT work. She has had occasional periods of increased worry — particularly in September when she experienced a lull in freelance work — but was able to manage these episodes without crisis and they resolved when her workload stabilized.

She continues Sertraline 50 mg daily. No side effects. No missed doses. She is not interested in tapering the medication at this time, as she feels it provides a "baseline stability" that she values, particularly given the inherent uncertainty of freelance work.

Sleep remains good — 7 hours per night, no significant insomnia. Appetite and energy are normal. She continues yoga twice weekly and has added occasional swimming at the Collingwood YMCA. She is socializing regularly in the community.

No new medical issues. No suicidal ideation. Pap test from May 2025 was normal (she received the result by phone in June).

### Objective
*Virtual visit — limited physical examination.*
- General: Well-appearing via video. Relaxed, good eye contact, appropriate affect.
- Mental status: Euthymic. Mood described as "good." Affect congruent, full range. No psychomotor abnormalities. Thought process linear, organized. Denies SI/HI. Insight and judgment intact.

Screening tools (completed electronically prior to visit):
- PHQ-9: 2/27 (minimal — improved from 3 in May 2025)
- GAD-7: 4/21 (minimal — improved from 5 in May 2025)

### Assessment
1. Generalized anxiety disorder — in remission. GAD-7 score 4 (minimal), which is below the clinical threshold of 5 for mild anxiety. This is the best score since monitoring began. PHQ-9 score 2 (minimal). Patient has achieved and sustained remission through a combination of Sertraline 50 mg and CBT skills. She is functioning well across all domains — occupational, social, and personal.
2. Medication review — Sertraline 50 mg PO daily has been well tolerated for over three years. Patient prefers to continue at current dose given sustained benefit and minimal side effect profile. This is a reasonable approach, particularly given family history of depression and the patient's preference for stability.

### Plan
1. Renew Sertraline 50 mg PO daily — prescription renewed for 12 months with 3 repeats (sufficient until next annual physical).
2. Discussed that tapering remains an option in the future if she chooses. Per Canadian clinical practice guidelines, if tapering is pursued, it should be done gradually (e.g., reducing by 25 mg every 4–6 weeks) with close monitoring for relapse.
3. Continue independent CBT skills practice, regular exercise, and social engagement.
4. Influenza vaccine — advised to get this season's vaccine at her local pharmacy. COVID-19 booster — check eligibility per current NACI recommendations.
5. Next visit at annual physical (approximately May 2026) unless concerns arise sooner.
6. Safety net reiterated: contact clinic, present to ED, or call 988 if she experiences a significant worsening of anxiety, depressive symptoms, or suicidal ideation.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: Annual physical in approximately May 2026; sooner if needed
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 6: 2026-01-14 — Acute Anxiety Flare (Telephone Visit)

- Date: 2026-01-14
- Time: 16:45
- Type: Walk-in (same-day telephone appointment)
- Setting: Family Health Team (Telephone)
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Acute worsening of anxiety symptoms over past 10 days

### Subjective
Ms. Khan called the Hamilton Mountain FHT this morning requesting an urgent appointment. She was offered a same-day telephone visit with Dr. Moreau. She reports that over the past 10 days, her anxiety has worsened significantly. She attributes this to a convergence of stressors: a major freelance client terminated their contract unexpectedly in early January, she is experiencing financial uncertainty, and a close friend in Hamilton was hospitalized for a serious illness, which has been distressing.

She describes feeling "constantly on edge" with a return of persistent, uncontrollable worry. She is having difficulty concentrating on remaining work tasks. Her sleep has deteriorated — she is taking 45–60 minutes to fall asleep, waking 2–3 times per night, and getting approximately 5 hours of sleep. She has noticed increased muscle tension, particularly in her neck and shoulders, and tension-type headaches occurring 3–4 times per week. She has had one episode that she describes as a "near panic attack" — rapid heart rate, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and derealization lasting approximately 10 minutes. It resolved spontaneously and she was able to use breathing techniques to calm herself. She has not had a full panic attack.

Appetite is reduced. She has lost interest in yoga and swimming over the past two weeks. She denies alcohol or substance use to cope. She has been trying to use her CBT techniques but finds them "harder to access" when the anxiety is this intense.

She denies suicidal ideation, self-harm, or hopelessness. She states she "wants to feel better" and "knows this will pass" but is struggling. No psychotic symptoms.

She continues Sertraline 50 mg daily. No missed doses. No new medications or supplements.

### Objective
*Telephone visit — no physical examination or vitals available.*
- Voice: Slightly pressured, mildly tremulous at times. Becomes calmer as conversation progresses.
- Mental status (assessed via telephone): Alert, oriented, coherent. Mood described as "anxious and overwhelmed." Affect anxious, tearful at points, but responsive to reassurance. Thought process linear, organized. Thought content focused on worry about finances and friend's health. No suicidal or homicidal ideation — explicitly asked and denied. No psychotic symptoms. Insight intact — patient recognizes this is an anxiety exacerbation. Judgment intact — seeking help appropriately.

Screening tools (administered verbally):
- PHQ-9: 8/27 (mild depressive symptoms — increase from 2 in October 2025; items endorsed: insomnia, fatigue, poor concentration, appetite change)
- GAD-7: 14/21 (moderate-severe anxiety — increase from 4 in October 2025; items endorsed: feeling anxious nearly every day, uncontrollable worry, difficulty relaxing, restlessness, irritability)

### Assessment
1. Generalized anxiety disorder — acute exacerbation, moderate-severe. GAD-7 has risen from 4 (remission) to 14 (moderate-severe), clearly linked to identifiable psychosocial stressors (job loss, financial uncertainty, friend's illness). Patient experienced one near-panic episode but does not meet criteria for panic disorder at this time. Sleep is significantly disrupted. Functioning is impaired but not incapacitated — she is still able to manage basic activities and is engaging help appropriately.
2. Adjustment-related depressive symptoms — PHQ-9 increased from 2 to 8. Symptoms appear reactive to the stressors and secondary to the anxiety exacerbation rather than a new major depressive episode. Will monitor closely.
3. Insomnia — recurrent, anxiety-related. Sleep latency increased to 45–60 minutes with frequent awakenings.
4. Tension-type headaches — likely secondary to muscle tension from anxiety. No red flags for secondary headache (no sudden onset, neurological symptoms, fever, or neck stiffness).

Discussed management options:
- Option A: Increase Sertraline from 50 mg to 75 mg, with plan to reassess in 2–3 weeks
- Option B: Maintain current Sertraline dose and intensify non-pharmacological strategies, reassess in 1–2 weeks
- Option C: Short-term benzodiazepine (e.g., Lorazepam) for acute symptom relief — discussed risks including dependence, sedation, and cognitive effects; reserved for more severe or treatment-refractory presentations

Patient prefers Option A — modest dose increase combined with re-engagement with CBT strategies.

### Plan
1. Increase Sertraline to 75 mg PO daily, effective immediately. Advised that full therapeutic effect of dose increase may take 2–4 weeks. Discussed potential transient side effects of dose adjustment (mild nausea, headache, initial anxiety increase) and that these typically resolve within 1–2 weeks.
2. Avoid benzodiazepines at this time per shared decision-making. Patient is managing the acute symptoms with CBT techniques and the clinical picture does not warrant anxiolytic rescue medication currently. If symptoms worsen acutely (severe panic, inability to function, suicidal ideation), patient to present to Collingwood General & Marine Hospital ED or call 911.
3. Re-engage CBT: Encouraged patient to restart formal CBT. Offered referral back to the OSP program or, for faster access, a private registered psychotherapist with virtual availability. Patient will explore her options and report back. In the interim, she was encouraged to resume daily practice of relaxation techniques (progressive muscle relaxation, diaphragmatic breathing, scheduled worry time).
4. Sleep hygiene reinforced: Consistent sleep-wake schedule, limit news and social media consumption in the evening, relaxation routine before bed. If insomnia persists despite anxiety management, may consider short-term low-dose Trazodone at next visit.
5. Tension headaches: Acetaminophen 500 mg PO every 6 hours as needed. Consider adding gentle neck stretches and heat application. If headaches persist, will assess more formally at follow-up.
6. Encouraged maintenance of physical activity — even short walks are beneficial and should not wait for motivation to return.
7. Social support: Encouraged reaching out to family and friends. Discussed availability of the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA) Simcoe County branch, which offers peer support and community programs.
8. Close follow-up scheduled — telephone or virtual visit in 2 weeks to reassess response to dose increase and symptom trajectory.
9. Safety plan reviewed: If suicidal ideation, severe panic, or inability to care for self — present to nearest ED, call 911, or call 988 (Suicide Crisis Helpline). Patient confirmed understanding.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 2 weeks (telephone or virtual) for reassessment of anxiety exacerbation and Sertraline dose adjustment response
- Referrals: Patient to self-refer to OSP program or private psychotherapist for CBT re-engagement; CMHA Simcoe County for community support resources
