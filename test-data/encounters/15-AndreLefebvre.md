## Encounter 1: 2024-04-16 — FP Visit / OSA and CPAP Compliance Review

- Date: 2024-04-16
- Time: 10:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Halton Hills Family Health Team, 1 Mountainview Rd S, Georgetown, ON
- Practitioner: Dr. Catherine Brooks, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-64755)
- Reason for visit: OSA follow-up and CPAP compliance review

### Subjective
Mr. Lefebvre presents for his first follow-up with his rostered family physician since initiating CPAP therapy in October 2023. He was diagnosed with moderate obstructive sleep apnea following a home sleep study arranged by Dr. Michael Torres (Respirology, Hamilton General Hospital) in summer 2023. The diagnostic study showed an AHI of 22 events/hour, consistent with moderate OSA. He was fitted with a ResMed AirSense 11 with a full-face mask (AirFit F30i) in October 2023 through a home care vendor (VitalAire, Barrie). He received ADP funding approval for the device.

He reports using the CPAP most nights but admits he has been removing it in the middle of the night approximately 2-3 times per week due to mask discomfort and dry mouth. He estimates average nightly use of 4-5 hours. He feels somewhat improved in terms of daytime somnolence but still notices fatigue by mid-afternoon, particularly on days after he has removed the mask early. His spouse reports that his snoring has significantly decreased on nights he uses the device. He denies witnessed apneas since starting CPAP.

No morning headaches. No nocturia. Mood is stable. He mentions mild nasal congestion with CPAP use, particularly in the winter months. No chest pain, dyspnea, orthopnea, or leg swelling. No weight change since his respirology assessment.

He relocated from Oakville to Barrie in early 2024 for work and is establishing care locally. He has maintained his referral relationship with Dr. Torres in Hamilton.

Past medical history: Moderate OSA (AHI 22, diagnosed 2023). No other medical conditions. No prior surgeries.

Family history: Father with hypertension and Type 2 diabetes. Mother alive and well. No family history of stroke or sudden cardiac death.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 132/84 mmHg, HR 76 bpm, RR 14, Temp 36.5C, SpO2 97% RA
- Weight: 96.2 kg, Height: 183 cm, BMI: 28.7 kg/m2
- Neck circumference: 42.5 cm
- General: Well-appearing male, mildly overweight habitus, NAD
- HEENT: Nasal mucosa mildly erythematous, no polyps visualized; oropharynx: Mallampati Class III, mild tonsillar hypertrophy (2+)
- CV: S1/S2 normal, no murmurs, JVP not elevated, no peripheral edema
- Resp: Clear bilaterally, no wheeze or crackles
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, obese habitus, no organomegaly
- Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS): 11/24 (pre-CPAP was 16/24 per respirology records)

CPAP data (patient brought SD card printout from VitalAire):
- 30-day average usage: 4.3 hours/night
- Percentage of nights used (>4 hrs): 58%
- Residual AHI on CPAP: 6.2 events/hour
- Mask leak: moderate (average 28 L/min; target <24 L/min)
- Pressure range: 8-14 cmH2O (auto-titrating)

### Assessment
1. Obstructive sleep apnea, moderate — on CPAP therapy. Suboptimal compliance: average 4.3 hrs/night, below the minimum recommended threshold of 4 hrs on only 58% of nights. Residual AHI 6.2 on CPAP is improved from baseline AHI 22 but not fully optimized. Elevated mask leak suggesting poor mask fit contributing to early removal and dry mouth symptoms.
2. Nasal congestion on CPAP — likely related to inadequate humidification and/or mask leak causing oral air leak and nasal drying.
3. Overweight (BMI 28.7) — contributes to OSA severity. No active weight management program in place.
4. Borderline elevated blood pressure (132/84) — may be related to suboptimally treated OSA. Warrants monitoring.

### Plan
1. CPAP compliance: counselled patient extensively on importance of consistent use for the full sleep period. Discussed link between OSA, cardiovascular disease, daytime performance, and motor vehicle accident risk. Target >4 hours/night on >70% of nights.
2. Mask fit: recommend return to VitalAire Barrie for mask refit session. Consider switching to nasal pillow mask (ResMed AirFit P30i) if patient is amenable, as this may reduce leak and improve comfort. Suggest trialling a chin strap if switching to nasal mask.
3. Humidification: increase heated humidifier setting on AirSense 11 to level 6 and enable Climate Control. Consider heated tubing if not already in use to reduce condensation and improve comfort.
4. Nasal congestion: start saline nasal irrigation (NeilMed sinus rinse) nightly before bed. If persistent, consider trial of fluticasone nasal spray 50 mcg, 2 sprays each nostril at bedtime.
5. Weight management: discussed benefit of even modest weight loss (5-10% of body weight) on AHI reduction. Referral to registered dietitian through the FHT for nutrition counselling. Encourage 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity exercise.
6. Blood pressure: recheck at next visit. If persistently above 135/85, will consider further workup and management.
7. Continue follow-up with Dr. Torres (Respirology) — next appointment scheduled for August 2024.
8. Lab requisition provided: fasting glucose, lipid panel, CBC, creatinine, TSH — baseline cardiovascular risk assessment given OSA diagnosis.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 3 months or after respirology visit
- Referrals: VitalAire Barrie (mask refit), Registered dietitian (Halton Hills FHT)

## Encounter 2: 2024-08-20 — Respirology Follow-up / CPAP Data Review

- Date: 2024-08-20
- Time: 14:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Specialist Clinic
- Organization: Hamilton General Hospital — Respirology
- Practitioner: Dr. Michael Torres, MD FRCPC (Respirology) (ON-PRAC-77108)
- Reason for visit: Follow-up for moderate OSA; CPAP data review and optimization

### Subjective
Mr. Lefebvre returns for scheduled respirology follow-up approximately 10 months after CPAP initiation. He reports improvement in compliance since his visit with Dr. Brooks in April. He had a mask refit at VitalAire in May 2024 and was switched from a full-face mask (AirFit F30i) to a nasal pillow mask (AirFit P30i) with a chin strap. He reports this is significantly more comfortable and he is now able to keep the mask on for most of the night. He also increased the humidifier setting and started using a heated tube, which has resolved his nasal congestion and dry mouth.

He feels notably more rested in the mornings. His spouse confirms snoring is essentially absent when he uses the device. Daytime sleepiness has improved — he no longer needs to fight to stay alert during afternoon meetings. He has been using saline nasal rinses as recommended and has not required nasal steroid spray.

He has started walking 30 minutes, 3-4 times per week, and has seen a dietitian once at the Halton Hills FHT. He has lost approximately 2 kg since April. No chest pain, palpitations, or dyspnea. No morning headaches. Mood is good. Sleep onset is not delayed; he falls asleep within 15-20 minutes.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 128/80 mmHg, HR 72 bpm, SpO2 98% RA
- Weight: 94.1 kg (down 2.1 kg from April 2024), BMI: 28.1 kg/m2
- Neck circumference: 42.0 cm
- General: Well-appearing, NAD
- HEENT: Nasal mucosa healthy, no erythema. Oropharynx: Mallampati III, tonsillar hypertrophy 2+ unchanged
- CV: Normal S1/S2, regular rate, no murmurs
- Resp: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
- ESS: 7/24 (improved from 11 in April 2024, and from 16 at diagnosis)

CPAP data (downloaded from ResMed myAir cloud and SD card):
- 30-day average usage: 6.1 hours/night
- Percentage of nights used (>4 hrs): 82%
- Residual AHI on CPAP: 3.4 events/hour
- Mask leak: low (average 12 L/min; target <24 L/min)
- 90th percentile pressure: 11.2 cmH2O
- Pressure range: 7-14 cmH2O (auto-titrating)

Lab results (drawn 2024-05-10, per Dr. Brooks):
- Fasting glucose: 5.6 mmol/L
- Total cholesterol: 5.1 mmol/L, LDL 3.2 mmol/L, HDL 1.1 mmol/L, TG 1.8 mmol/L
- TSH: 1.8 mIU/L
- Creatinine: 82 umol/L, eGFR >90
- CBC: within normal limits

### Assessment
1. Obstructive sleep apnea, moderate — significantly improved on CPAP. Compliance now excellent: 6.1 hrs/night average, 82% of nights above 4-hour threshold. Residual AHI 3.4 events/hour, which is well within the normal range (<5 events/hour) and represents a substantial reduction from the diagnostic AHI of 22. ESS improved from 16 (pre-treatment) to 7 (normal range).
2. Mask switch successful — nasal pillow mask with chin strap is well-tolerated. Leak resolved.
3. Overweight (BMI 28.1) — modest weight loss of 2.1 kg since April. Encouraged to continue.
4. Dyslipidemia — LDL 3.2 mmol/L. Given OSA and cardiovascular risk, will defer to Dr. Brooks for lipid management. OSA is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease; adequate CPAP use mitigates some of this risk.

### Plan
1. Continue current CPAP settings (auto-titrating, 7-14 cmH2O) with AirFit P30i nasal pillow mask and chin strap. No changes indicated — therapy well-optimized.
2. Reinforce importance of nightly CPAP use. Goal: maintain >4 hours/night on >70% of nights (currently exceeding this target).
3. Continue saline nasal rinses PRN; no nasal steroid required at this time.
4. Weight loss: encourage continued efforts. Even a 10% reduction in body weight may permit reassessment of OSA severity and potentially reduce required CPAP pressure.
5. Cardiovascular risk: communicate lab results to Dr. Brooks for lipid and BP management. OSA confers independent cardiovascular risk; recommend fasting lipids and BP be addressed at primary care level.
6. Replace CPAP mask and tubing per ADP replacement schedule (mask cushion every 3 months, headgear every 6 months, tubing every 6 months).
7. Return to respirology in 12-15 months for routine follow-up, or sooner if compliance declines, symptoms recur, or significant weight change.
8. Copy of report to Dr. Catherine Brooks, Halton Hills FHT.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: Respirology in 12-15 months (fall 2025)
- Referrals: None; report to Dr. C. Brooks, Halton Hills FHT

- Organization: Halton Hills Family Health Team, 1 Mountainview Rd S, Georgetown, ON
- Practitioner: Dr. Catherine Brooks, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-64755)
- Reason for visit: Annual health examination and comprehensive review

### Subjective
Mr. Lefebvre presents for his annual physical examination. He reports feeling well overall. CPAP therapy continues to go well — he uses it nightly and feels well-rested. He reports compliance remains consistent and he has had no issues with the nasal pillow mask since the switch in May 2024. No recurrence of snoring per his spouse.

He denies chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, orthopnea, or leg swelling. No GI symptoms, urinary symptoms, or musculoskeletal complaints. No mood changes or sleep onset difficulties. Denies tobacco use. Alcohol remains 2-3 beers per week. No recreational drug use. No new medications or supplements.

He received his influenza and COVID-19 vaccines in October 2024. He has not had any screening colonoscopy; he is under 50 and has no family history of colorectal cancer. No prior PSA testing.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 126/78 mmHg, HR 70 bpm, RR 14, Temp 36.5C, SpO2 98% RA
- Weight: 92.8 kg (down 3.4 kg from April 2024), Height: 183 cm, BMI: 27.7 kg/m2
- General: Well-appearing, no acute distress
- HEENT: PERRL, oropharynx clear, no thyromegaly, TMs clear bilaterally
- Neck: Supple, no lymphadenopathy
- CV: S1/S2 normal, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, JVP not elevated
- Resp: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheeze or crackles
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly, no masses
- Extremities: No edema, peripheral pulses 2+ bilaterally
- Skin: No suspicious lesions. No acanthosis nigricans
- Mental health screen: PHQ-2 score 0/6

Lab results (fasting, drawn 2025-01-07):
- Fasting glucose: 5.4 mmol/L
- HbA1c: 5.5%
- Total cholesterol: 4.9 mmol/L, LDL 3.0 mmol/L, HDL 1.2 mmol/L, TG 1.6 mmol/L
- Creatinine: 80 umol/L, eGFR >90 mL/min/1.73m2
- ALT: 26 U/L
- TSH: 2.0 mIU/L
- CBC: WBC 5.8, Hgb 152, Plt 228 — all within normal limits
- Urine dipstick: negative for protein, glucose, blood

CPAP data (reviewed via myAir app on patient's phone):
- 30-day average usage: 6.4 hours/night
- Percentage of nights used (>4 hrs): 86%
- Residual AHI: 2.8 events/hour

### Assessment
1. Obstructive sleep apnea, moderate — well-controlled on CPAP. Excellent compliance (6.4 hrs/night, 86% of nights >4 hrs). Residual AHI 2.8, within normal limits. ESS was 7 at last respirology visit; patient reports subjective improvement maintained.
2. Overweight (BMI 27.7) — continued weight loss of 3.4 kg since April 2024. Trending toward healthy range. Lifestyle modifications are effective.
3. Dyslipidemia — LDL 3.0 mmol/L. Per CCS guidelines, primary prevention target for moderate-risk patients (male, 44, OSA, borderline lipids) is LDL <2.0 mmol/L if pharmacotherapy initiated. Current FRS is low-intermediate. Given OSA as an independent CV risk factor and LDL consistently above 3.0, discussed statin therapy.
4. Blood pressure — improved from 132/84 in April 2024 to 126/78 today. Likely related to improved CPAP compliance and weight loss. Currently within normal limits; no antihypertensive required.
5. Health maintenance — vaccines up to date. No screening colonoscopy indicated until age 50 (average risk). PSA discussion: informed patient about potential benefits and harms of PSA screening; patient defers testing at this time.

### Plan
1. Continue CPAP therapy — current settings and mask are well-optimized. Continue follow-up with Dr. Torres (Respirology) as scheduled.
2. Weight management: continue dietitian follow-up and exercise program. Goal: BMI <25 (target weight approximately 84 kg). Discussed that further weight loss may reduce OSA severity and potentially allow for a lower CPAP pressure setting.
3. Dyslipidemia: patient prefers to continue lifestyle modification for now rather than starting statin therapy. Will recheck fasting lipids in 6 months. If LDL remains above 3.0 or cardiovascular risk profile changes, will strongly recommend statin initiation.
4. Continue monitoring blood pressure at each visit.
5. Renew CPAP supplies through VitalAire per ADP schedule.
6. Influenza and COVID-19 vaccines completed for this season.
7. FIT (fecal immunochemical test) for colorectal cancer screening: not yet indicated (age 43). Will initiate at age 50 per Ontario screening guidelines.
8. Lab requisition provided for July 2025: fasting glucose, lipid panel.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 6 months (June/July 2025) for lipid recheck, or sooner if needed
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 4: 2025-06-24 — FP Visit / Weight Management and CPAP Compliance

- Date: 2025-06-24
- Time: 11:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Halton Hills Family Health Team, 1 Mountainview Rd S, Georgetown, ON
- Practitioner: Dr. Catherine Brooks, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-64755)
- Reason for visit: Follow-up for dyslipidemia, weight management, and CPAP compliance

### Subjective
Mr. Lefebvre returns for his 6-month follow-up as planned. He reports continued good compliance with CPAP therapy. He uses the device every night and rarely removes it before morning. He continues to feel well-rested and denies daytime somnolence. No snoring reported by his spouse.

Regarding weight management, he reports he has maintained his exercise routine (walking and cycling 4-5 times per week) and has been following the dietary recommendations from the FHT dietitian. He has been tracking his caloric intake using a smartphone app for the past three months, which he has found helpful. He reports his weight has plateaued somewhat over the past two months after a period of steady decline.

He raises a concern about occasional heartburn after large meals, occurring approximately once per week. He has been using over-the-counter calcium carbonate (Tums) with relief. No dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, melena, or hematemesis. He attributes this to eating too quickly at work lunches.

No chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, or edema. No musculoskeletal complaints. Mood is good. Sleep is refreshing. No changes in medications — he remains on no prescription medications.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 124/76 mmHg, HR 68 bpm, RR 14, SpO2 98% RA
- Weight: 91.5 kg (down 4.7 kg total from April 2024 baseline of 96.2 kg), BMI: 27.3 kg/m2
- General: Well-appearing, NAD
- CV: Normal S1/S2, regular rhythm, no murmurs
- Resp: Clear bilaterally
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no epigastric tenderness, no organomegaly

Lab results (fasting, drawn 2025-06-17):
- Fasting glucose: 5.3 mmol/L
- Total cholesterol: 4.7 mmol/L, LDL 2.8 mmol/L, HDL 1.3 mmol/L, TG 1.4 mmol/L
- ALT: 24 U/L

CPAP data (reviewed via myAir app):
- 30-day average usage: 6.8 hours/night
- Percentage of nights used (>4 hrs): 90%
- Residual AHI: 2.5 events/hour
- Mask leak: low (average 10 L/min)

### Assessment
1. Obstructive sleep apnea, moderate — well-controlled on CPAP. Compliance excellent and improving (6.8 hrs/night, 90% of nights >4 hrs). Residual AHI 2.5, well within normal limits. Symptoms resolved.
2. Overweight (BMI 27.3) — continued gradual weight loss. Total loss 4.7 kg over 14 months, consistent with a sustainable 1-2 kg/month rate. Weight has plateaued slightly; this is common and expected. Encouraged to continue current approach.
3. Dyslipidemia — LDL improved from 3.0 to 2.8 mmol/L with lifestyle changes. Given moderate cardiovascular risk (OSA, male, age 44), LDL target of <2.0 would require pharmacotherapy. However, trend is favorable and patient is motivated by lifestyle approach. Reasonable to continue monitoring.
4. Occasional GERD symptoms — mild, intermittent, responsive to antacids. No alarm features. Likely related to dietary habits and overweight. No indication for investigation at this time.
5. Blood pressure — well-controlled at 124/76. Continued improvement trend, likely related to weight loss and effective CPAP use.

### Plan
1. Continue CPAP therapy — no changes. Reinforce excellent compliance.
2. Weight management: plateau is normal — reassure. Suggest modest increase in exercise intensity (consider adding resistance training 2x/week to increase metabolic rate). Continue dietitian follow-up PRN. Long-term goal remains BMI <25.
3. Dyslipidemia: given improving trend with lifestyle, will defer statin initiation for now. Recheck lipids at annual physical (January 2026). If LDL remains above 2.8 or weight loss stalls, will revisit discussion regarding rosuvastatin 10 mg.
4. GERD: lifestyle counselling — avoid eating within 3 hours of bedtime, elevate head of bed (beneficial for both GERD and CPAP use), reduce fatty and spicy foods, eat smaller more frequent meals. Continue Tums PRN. If symptoms increase in frequency (>2x/week) or fail to respond to antacids, consider trial of PPI. Note: CPAP use with elevated CPAP pressures can occasionally contribute to aerophagia and reflux — current pressures are moderate and this is unlikely to be the primary contributor.
5. Respirology follow-up with Dr. Torres due in fall 2025. Encourage patient to keep this appointment.
6. Lab requisition for January 2026 annual physical: fasting glucose, HbA1c, lipid panel, CBC, creatinine, ALT, TSH.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: January 2026 for annual physical, or sooner if GERD worsens or new concerns
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 5: 2025-11-18 — Respirology Follow-up

- Date: 2025-11-18
- Time: 10:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Specialist Clinic
- Organization: Hamilton General Hospital — Respirology
- Practitioner: Dr. Michael Torres, MD FRCPC (Respirology) (ON-PRAC-77108)
- Reason for visit: Routine respirology follow-up for moderate OSA; annual CPAP review

### Subjective
Mr. Lefebvre returns for routine respirology follow-up, approximately 15 months since his last visit. He reports excellent adherence to CPAP therapy. He uses the ResMed AirSense 11 with AirFit P30i nasal pillow mask and chin strap every night. He feels well-rested, alert during the day, and has had no recurrence of excessive daytime somnolence. His spouse confirms no snoring or witnessed apneas.

He reports continued gradual weight loss since his last respirology visit (was 94.1 kg in August 2024). He has been maintaining regular exercise and dietary changes. He asks whether his weight loss could eventually allow him to stop CPAP or reduce usage.

He replaced his mask cushion and tubing through VitalAire in September 2025 as scheduled under ADP. No equipment issues. He mentions he recently started using the ResMed myAir app more actively and finds the nightly score motivating.

He reports occasional mild heartburn (discussed with Dr. Brooks in June 2025) that has improved with dietary changes. No other new symptoms. No chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, or leg swelling. No mood concerns.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 122/76 mmHg, HR 68 bpm, SpO2 98% RA
- Weight: 90.3 kg (down from 94.1 kg at last respirology visit; down 5.9 kg from baseline 96.2 kg), BMI: 27.0 kg/m2
- Neck circumference: 41.0 cm (reduced from 42.5 cm at baseline)
- General: Well-appearing, NAD, appears slimmer than previous visit
- HEENT: Nasal mucosa healthy, no congestion. Oropharynx: Mallampati III unchanged
- CV: Normal S1/S2, regular rhythm, no murmurs, no edema
- Resp: Clear bilaterally, no adventitious sounds
- ESS: 5/24 (normal; improved from 7 at last respirology visit, 16 at diagnosis)

CPAP data (downloaded from SD card and myAir):
- 90-day average usage: 6.9 hours/night
- Percentage of nights used (>4 hrs): 92%
- Residual AHI on CPAP: 2.1 events/hour
- 90th percentile pressure: 10.4 cmH2O (decreased from 11.2 in Aug 2024)
- Mask leak: low (average 8 L/min)
- No central apneas or Cheyne-Stokes pattern on detailed flow data

Review of labs from Dr. Brooks (June 2025): fasting glucose 5.3, LDL 2.8, HDL 1.3. No concerns from respirology perspective.

### Assessment
1. Obstructive sleep apnea, moderate — very well-controlled on CPAP. Compliance is excellent (6.9 hrs/night average, 92% of nights >4 hrs — exceeds all guideline thresholds). Residual AHI 2.1, essentially normalized. ESS 5/24, indicating no residual daytime somnolence. 90th percentile pressure has decreased from 11.2 to 10.4 cmH2O, likely reflecting reduced upper airway collapsibility associated with weight loss.
2. Weight loss — 5.9 kg total since CPAP initiation. BMI improved from 28.7 to 27.0. Neck circumference reduced by 1.5 cm. These changes are contributing to improved OSA parameters.
3. Regarding patient's question about discontinuing CPAP: while weight loss is improving his OSA indices, moderate OSA with an original AHI of 22 is unlikely to resolve with the current degree of weight loss alone. CPAP remains indicated. If patient achieves target BMI <25 (approximately 84 kg), a repeat diagnostic sleep study off CPAP could be considered to reassess.

### Plan
1. Continue CPAP therapy with current settings (auto-titrating 7-14 cmH2O, AirFit P30i nasal pillows with chin strap). No adjustments needed — therapy is optimally titrated.
2. Discussed discontinuation question: CPAP remains necessary at current weight. Benchmark for reassessment: if patient reaches BMI <25 (approximately 84 kg), will arrange a repeat home sleep study off CPAP to determine if OSA has resolved or downgraded to mild severity. Even if AHI improves, patient may benefit from continued CPAP use for cardiovascular protection.
3. Encourage continued weight loss efforts — positive trajectory. Even partial remission of OSA with further weight loss would be clinically meaningful.
4. ADP CPAP device replacement: current device was obtained in October 2023. ADP covers replacement every 5 years. Device is functioning well; no replacement needed at this time. Continue replacing consumables per schedule (cushion q3mo, headgear q6mo, tubing q6mo, filter q1mo).
5. No indication for repeat polysomnography at this time given well-controlled parameters on CPAP.
6. Report to Dr. Catherine Brooks, Halton Hills FHT.
7. Return to respirology in 12 months (fall 2026), or sooner if compliance declines, symptoms recur, or if patient reaches BMI target and wishes to trial off CPAP.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: Respirology in 12 months (November 2026)
- Referrals: None; report to Dr. C. Brooks, Halton Hills FHT
