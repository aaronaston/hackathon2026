- Date: 2024-03-12
- Time: 10:15
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Kitchener-Waterloo Family Health Team (200 King St W, Suite 400, Kitchener)
- Practitioner: Dr. Robert Osei, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-65189)
- Reason for visit: Annual health examination; blood pressure and lipid panel review

### Subjective
Ms. Silva presents for her annual physical examination. She is a 49-year-old female with a history of hypertension diagnosed approximately three years ago and dyslipidemia identified on screening bloodwork two years prior. She reports good adherence to amlodipine 5 mg daily and atorvastatin 20 mg nightly. She denies chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, or visual changes. She notes occasional mild headaches, which she attributes to long hours at her restaurant. She owns and operates a Portuguese-Canadian restaurant on King Street and reports high stress levels, working 10-12 hour days, six days a week. She denies tobacco use. Alcohol intake is approximately 4-5 glasses of wine per week. Diet is variable given her work environment; she acknowledges difficulty maintaining a low-sodium diet. No family history updates since last visit (father had MI at age 62; mother has type 2 diabetes). No allergies.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 142/88 mmHg (left arm, seated, resting 5 min), HR 78 bpm regular, RR 16, Temp 36.6 C, SpO2 98% RA
- Height: 160 cm, Weight: 72.2 kg, BMI: 28.2
- General: Well-appearing, no acute distress
- HEENT: PERRLA, oropharynx clear, thyroid non-palpable
- CVS: S1/S2 normal, no murmurs, no JVD, peripheral pulses 2+ bilaterally
- Resp: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly
- Extremities: No peripheral edema
- Skin: No concerning lesions

Lab results (fasting, drawn 2024-03-05):
- Total cholesterol: 5.4 mmol/L (elevated)
- LDL: 3.2 mmol/L (above target of <2.0 for moderate risk)
- HDL: 1.3 mmol/L
- Triglycerides: 1.9 mmol/L
- Fasting glucose: 5.6 mmol/L
- HbA1c: 5.8%
- Creatinine: 72 umol/L, eGFR >90
- Electrolytes: Normal
- TSH: 2.1 mIU/L
- CBC: Within normal limits
- Urinalysis: No protein, no glucose

### Assessment
1. Hypertension — suboptimally controlled. BP remains above target of <140/90 (or <130/80 given moderate cardiovascular risk per Hypertension Canada guidelines). Current amlodipine 5 mg may require dose adjustment or addition of second agent.
2. Dyslipidemia — LDL 3.2 mmol/L, above target for her Framingham risk score (estimated moderate risk given family history, age, and hypertension). Atorvastatin 20 mg may need uptitration.
3. Pre-diabetes — HbA1c 5.8%, fasting glucose 5.6 mmol/L. Warrants lifestyle counselling and monitoring.
4. BMI 28.2 — overweight category. Lifestyle modification encouraged.
5. Occupational stress — high workload, limited time for self-care.

### Plan
1. Continue amlodipine 5 mg daily. Recheck BP in 3 months; if still above target, consider increasing to 10 mg or adding a second agent (e.g., ramipril).
2. Increase atorvastatin to 40 mg nightly given LDL well above target. Repeat lipid panel in 3 months to assess response.
3. Lifestyle counselling provided: DASH diet handout given, reduce sodium intake, aim for 150 min/week moderate activity, limit alcohol to 1-2 drinks/day maximum. Discussed realistic strategies given her work schedule.
4. Cervical cancer screening: Pap test performed today (last done 2021). Await cytology results.
5. Discussed pre-diabetes risk and importance of dietary changes and physical activity.
6. Requisition provided for repeat fasting lipid panel and HbA1c in June 2024.
7. OHIP-covered annual physical completed. Preventive care checklist reviewed.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 3 months (June 2024) for BP recheck and lipid panel review
- Referrals: None at this time

- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Kitchener-Waterloo Family Health Team (200 King St W, Suite 400, Kitchener)
- Practitioner: Dr. Robert Osei, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-65189)
- Reason for visit: Follow-up blood pressure and lipid panel review; medication reassessment

### Subjective
Ms. Silva returns for scheduled 3-month follow-up as arranged at her March annual physical. She reports she has been trying to reduce sodium intake and has started walking for 20-30 minutes on her day off, but acknowledges limited progress with lifestyle changes due to restaurant demands. She has been compliant with amlodipine 5 mg daily. She did increase atorvastatin to 40 mg nightly as directed, but reports mild muscle aching in her thighs that began approximately 3-4 weeks ago. The aching is non-debilitating and she is unsure if it is related to the medication or to being on her feet all day. She denies any dark urine, significant weakness, or fever. No chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations. Headaches have been somewhat less frequent. She completed the Pap test in March — inquires about the result.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 144/90 mmHg (left arm, seated, resting 5 min), repeat BP 140/88 mmHg (right arm), HR 76 bpm regular
- Weight: 71.8 kg (down 0.4 kg from March)
- General: Well-appearing
- CVS: Normal S1/S2, no murmurs
- MSK: No focal tenderness in thighs or calves, full ROM lower extremities, no swelling

Lab results (fasting, drawn 2024-06-11):

- CK: 185 U/L (within normal limits, ref <200)
- ALT: 28 U/L (normal)
- Creatinine: 70 umol/L, eGFR >90

Pap cytology (March 2024): Negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy.

### Assessment
1. Hypertension — still above target. BP averaging 140-144/88-90 despite amlodipine 5 mg daily. Requires addition of a second antihypertensive agent.
2. Dyslipidemia — LDL improved from 3.2 to 2.5 mmol/L on atorvastatin 40 mg, but still above optimal target of <2.0 mmol/L. Mild myalgia present but CK normal — likely low-grade statin-related myalgia vs. occupational.
3. Pre-diabetes — HbA1c stable at 5.7%, slight improvement. Continue lifestyle modification.
4. Cervical screening — Pap negative, routine recall.

### Plan
1. Add ramipril 2.5 mg daily for blood pressure. Discussed ACE inhibitor side effects (cough, angioedema — rare). Check creatinine and potassium in 2 weeks.
2. Continue atorvastatin 40 mg nightly. Monitor myalgia symptoms — if worsening, will consider switching to rosuvastatin. CK reassuring at present.
3. Continue amlodipine 5 mg daily.
4. Lifestyle counselling reinforced. Encouraged even 10-15 minute walks during work breaks.
5. Requisition provided for creatinine + potassium in 2 weeks (post-ramipril initiation).

- Time: 11:45
- Type: Walk-in
- Setting: Walk-in Clinic
- Organization: Dundas Walk-in Clinic
- Practitioner: Dr. Martin Chou, MD
- Reason for visit: Acute headache and neck tension, three days duration

### Subjective
Ms. Silva presents to the walk-in clinic with a 3-day history of persistent headache, primarily bifrontal and radiating to the posterior neck. She describes it as a constant, dull ache rated 6/10, worsened with stress and prolonged standing. She reports the headache began during a particularly busy week at her restaurant (summer patio season) and she has been sleeping only 4-5 hours per night. She has tried acetaminophen 500 mg twice daily with minimal relief. She denies visual changes, aura, photophobia, nausea, vomiting, focal weakness, numbness, or speech difficulties. No recent head trauma. No fever.

She reports she is followed by Dr. Robert Osei at the Kitchener-Waterloo Family Health Team for hypertension and dyslipidemia. Current medications: amlodipine 5 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg nightly, ramipril 2.5 mg daily (started June 2024). She has no drug allergies. She has not checked her blood pressure at home recently.

- Neck: Significant bilateral trapezius and cervical paraspinal muscle tenderness, full ROM but painful at end-range flexion and rotation
- CVS: S1/S2 normal, no murmurs

### Assessment
1. Tension-type headache — most likely etiology given bilateral, non-pulsatile character, cervical muscle tenderness, sleep deprivation, and high stress. No red flags for secondary headache.
2. Hypertension — elevated today at 148/92 in context of pain and stress. Patient on triple therapy (amlodipine, ramipril, atorvastatin for lipids). Needs follow-up with family physician for BP optimization.

### Plan
1. Naproxen 250 mg PO BID with food for 5-7 days for headache and cervical muscle tension. Avoid prolonged use given hypertension.
2. Acetaminophen 1000 mg PO q6h PRN as adjunct if needed.
3. Heat application to cervical region. Gentle neck stretching exercises demonstrated.
4. Strongly advised to prioritize sleep hygiene — aim for 7+ hours. Discussed stress management strategies briefly.
5. Do not adjust antihypertensive medications — defer to Dr. Osei for BP management.
6. Advised to book follow-up with Dr. Osei for BP reassessment, particularly given elevated reading today.
7. Return precautions: seek emergency care for sudden severe "thunderclap" headache, visual loss, focal weakness, confusion, or fever with neck stiffness.

### Disposition

- Date: 2025-01-14
- Time: 13:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Specialist Clinic
- Organization: Hamilton General Hospital — Cardiology
- Practitioner: Dr. Naveed Hussain, MD FRCPC (ON-PRAC-75892)
- Reason for visit: Cardiology consultation for cardiovascular risk assessment; referral from Dr. Robert Osei, Kitchener-Waterloo Family Health Team

### Subjective
Ms. Silva is a 49-year-old female referred by Dr. Osei for comprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment in the context of hypertension, dyslipidemia, pre-diabetes, and a positive family history (father with MI at age 62). She reports that her blood pressure has been improving since ramipril was increased to 5 mg daily in October 2024 — home readings are approximately 130-136/80-86 mmHg. She continues amlodipine 5 mg daily and atorvastatin 40 mg nightly. She denies exertional chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, palpitations, syncope, or presyncope. Her exercise tolerance is reasonable — she walks 20-30 minutes at a brisk pace without symptoms. She denies orthopnea or PND. She reports some shortness of breath when climbing stairs to the restaurant's second-floor storage, but attributes this to deconditioning. No leg swelling. She owns a restaurant and is on her feet most of the day. No tobacco use. Alcohol 3-4 glasses of wine per week. No recreational drug use. No allergies.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 134/82 mmHg (left arm, seated), HR 72 bpm regular, SpO2 98% RA
- Weight: 70.5 kg
- General: Well-appearing, no distress
- CVS: Normal S1/S2, no S3/S4, no murmurs, JVP not elevated, carotid upstrokes normal without bruits, peripheral pulses 2+ symmetrical in all four extremities
- Resp: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no crackles
- Abdomen: Soft, no aortic bruit, no hepatomegaly
- Extremities: No peripheral edema, no cyanosis
- ECG (12-lead, done in clinic): Normal sinus rhythm, rate 70, normal axis, no LVH criteria, no ST-T wave changes, no Q waves, PR 160 ms, QTc 420 ms

Lab results (fasting, drawn 2025-01-07 in Kitchener):
- Total cholesterol: 3.9 mmol/L
- LDL: 1.9 mmol/L (at target)
- HDL: 1.5 mmol/L
- Triglycerides: 1.3 mmol/L
- HbA1c: 5.6%
- Fasting glucose: 5.2 mmol/L
- Creatinine: 68 umol/L, eGFR >90
- Potassium: 4.3 mmol/L
- hs-CRP: 1.8 mg/L (low-to-moderate risk)

### Assessment
1. Hypertension — better controlled on amlodipine 5 mg + ramipril 5 mg. In-office BP 134/82 today. Home readings in acceptable range, trending toward target.
2. Dyslipidemia — well-controlled on atorvastatin 40 mg. LDL 1.9 mmol/L has reached target.
3. Cardiovascular risk assessment — moderate 10-year risk by Framingham score (estimated 12-14%) accounting for family history, hypertension, dyslipidemia, pre-diabetes, and age. ECG is normal. No clinical features suggestive of ischemic heart disease. The mild exertional dyspnea on stairs is more likely deconditioning than anginal equivalent, but warrants functional assessment.
4. Pre-diabetes — stable, within monitoring range.

### Plan
1. Exercise stress test (treadmill, Bruce protocol) ordered to assess functional capacity and rule out inducible ischemia. Appointment to be scheduled at Hamilton General Hospital within 4-6 weeks.
2. Continue current medications unchanged: amlodipine 5 mg daily, ramipril 5 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg nightly.
3. Lifestyle recommendations reinforced: progressive increase in aerobic activity, Mediterranean-style diet, weight management. Ideal target weight ~62-65 kg for her height.
4. If stress test is normal, continued management with family physician is appropriate. No need for further cardiac imaging at this time.
5. Consultation report to be sent to Dr. Osei.

Stress test result (performed 2025-02-11 at Hamilton General Hospital):
- Completed 9 minutes of Bruce protocol (stage 3)
- Achieved 95% of age-predicted maximal heart rate
- No chest pain during or after exercise
- No significant ST-segment changes
- Normal blood pressure response to exercise (peak 174/84 mmHg)
- No arrhythmias
- Interpretation: Normal exercise stress test. No evidence of inducible myocardial ischemia. Good functional capacity.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: Stress test result communicated to Dr. Osei with consultation letter. No further cardiology follow-up needed unless new symptoms arise.

- Screening mammogram (August 2025): BI-RADS 1 — negative. No suspicious findings. Routine screening recommended in 2 years.

### Assessment
1. Hypertension — well-controlled. BP 126/76 today, excellent. Continue current regimen.
2. Dyslipidemia — well-controlled. LDL 1.7, below target. No change needed.
3. Glycemic status — HbA1c 5.4%, normal range. Pre-diabetes has resolved. Continue healthy lifestyle.
4. Perimenopause — progressing. Increasing vasomotor symptoms. Last menstrual period 10 weeks ago. Does not meet criteria for menopause yet (12 months amenorrhea). Symptoms are mild-to-moderate.
5. Left knee — mild early osteoarthritic changes suspected based on age, occupation (prolonged standing), and crepitus. No signs of inflammatory arthritis.
6. Preventive screening — FIT negative, mammogram negative. On track.

### Plan
1. Continue amlodipine 5 mg daily, ramipril 5 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg nightly, vitamin D3 1000 IU daily. No changes.
2. Perimenopausal vasomotor symptoms: discussed options including lifestyle measures (layered clothing, cool bedroom, avoiding triggers). If symptoms worsen, can consider low-dose hormonal therapy given she has no contraindications. Patient prefers to monitor for now.
3. Left knee: advised regarding weight management (continued loss will be beneficial), appropriate footwear for restaurant work, and low-impact exercise. Yoga is excellent for knee health. May use acetaminophen PRN for discomfort. If worsening, will consider X-ray.
4. Communicated FIT and mammogram results — both reassuring. Next FIT in 2027, next mammogram in 2027.
5. Follow-up in 5-6 months or sooner if needed.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: February 2026 for BP/lipid review and medication renewal
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 9: 2025-11-04 — Walk-in for Musculoskeletal Complaint

- Date: 2025-11-04
- Time: 16:20
- Type: Walk-in
- Setting: Walk-in Clinic
- Organization: Dundas Walk-in Clinic
- Practitioner: Dr. Martin Chou, MD
- Reason for visit: Left knee pain, worsening over 2 weeks

### Subjective
Ms. Silva returns to the walk-in clinic reporting worsening left knee pain over the past 2 weeks. She was seen by Dr. Osei in September, who noted mild crepitus and morning stiffness in the left knee. Since then, the discomfort has increased, particularly after prolonged standing at work and when climbing stairs. She describes the pain as a deep ache over the anterior and medial knee, rated 5/10, worse at the end of the workday. The morning stiffness now lasts approximately 20-30 minutes. She has been taking acetaminophen 500 mg as needed (1-2 tablets daily) with partial relief. She denies any acute injury, locking, giving way, or significant swelling. She has not noticed any warmth or redness. She notes that the pain has limited her walking routine — she has reduced from daily walks to 2-3 times per week.

She is followed by Dr. Osei for hypertension and dyslipidemia. Current medications: amlodipine 5 mg daily, ramipril 5 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg nightly, vitamin D3 1000 IU daily. No allergies.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 130/80 mmHg (left arm, seated), HR 72 bpm
- Weight: 68.0 kg
- MSK — Left knee:
  - Inspection: No visible swelling, no erythema, no ecchymosis
  - Palpation: Mild tenderness along medial joint line, no warmth, small patellofemoral crepitus
  - ROM: Flexion 0-130 degrees (slight discomfort at terminal flexion), extension full
  - Ligaments: ACL (Lachman) negative, MCL/LCL stable, posterior drawer negative
  - Meniscal: McMurray test — mild discomfort on medial rotation but no click
  - Patellofemoral: Positive patellar grind test (Clarke's sign) with mild discomfort
  - Gait: Antalgic-free, no limp

### Assessment
1. Left knee pain — likely early patellofemoral syndrome with possible early osteoarthritis of the left knee. Clinical findings consistent with anterior knee pain exacerbated by occupational demands (prolonged standing, stairs). No evidence of internal derangement, ligamentous injury, or inflammatory arthritis. Age 50 and BMI 26.6 are consistent risk factors.
2. Hypertension — incidentally noted BP well-controlled at 130/80 today.

### Plan
1. Left knee X-ray ordered (AP and lateral, weight-bearing) at Grand River Hospital to assess for degenerative changes. Requisition provided.
2. Topical diclofenac gel (Voltaren) 1% — apply to left knee TID for 2-3 weeks. Preferred over oral NSAIDs given hypertension history.
3. Acetaminophen 500 mg — may continue PRN, up to 1000 mg TID.
4. Activity modification: avoid prolonged kneeling and deep squatting. Advised anti-fatigue mat at work station. Continue low-impact exercise (walking, yoga, swimming) as tolerated.
5. Quadriceps and hamstring strengthening exercises handout provided. Progressive resistance training for knee stabilization.
6. Follow-up with Dr. Osei for ongoing management. X-ray results to be communicated to family physician.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: With Dr. Osei (family physician) for X-ray results and ongoing knee management
- Referrals: X-ray requisition at Grand River Hospital

## Encounter 10: 2026-02-10 — BP / Lipid Review and Medication Renewal

- Date: 2026-02-10
- Time: 09:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Kitchener-Waterloo Family Health Team (200 King St W, Suite 400, Kitchener)
- Practitioner: Dr. Robert Osei, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-65189)
- Reason for visit: Blood pressure and lipid review; medication renewal; follow-up knee X-ray results

### Subjective
Ms. Silva presents for her scheduled follow-up and medication renewal. She reports feeling generally well. Her blood pressure has been consistently well-controlled at home — recent readings average 124-130/74-78. She continues all medications without side effects: amlodipine 5 mg daily, ramipril 5 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg nightly, vitamin D3 1000 IU daily. She completed her left knee X-ray at Grand River Hospital in November and has been using topical diclofenac as recommended by Dr. Chou. The knee pain has improved significantly — she rates it 2/10 on most days and the morning stiffness has decreased to about 10 minutes. She has resumed walking 30 minutes daily and continues yoga. She invested in proper supportive footwear for work and purchased anti-fatigue mats for the kitchen, both of which have helped. Quadriceps exercises have been done intermittently.

She reports that her last menstrual period was approximately 5 months ago. Hot flashes continue but remain manageable with lifestyle measures (cooling pillow, layered clothing). No abnormal bleeding. Mood is stable. Sleep is adequate at 6.5-7 hours per night with occasional interruption from hot flashes.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 126/76 mmHg (left arm, seated, resting 5 min), repeat 124/74 mmHg, HR 66 bpm regular, SpO2 99% RA
- Weight: 67.2 kg, BMI: 26.3

Left knee X-ray (2025-11-12, Grand River Hospital):
- Mild narrowing of the medial tibiofemoral compartment
- Small marginal osteophytes at the medial tibial plateau
- No fracture or dislocation
- Patellofemoral joint: mild lateral patellar tilt, no significant joint space narrowing
- Impression: Mild degenerative changes consistent with early osteoarthritis, medial compartment

Lab results (fasting, drawn 2026-02-03):
- Total cholesterol: 3.6 mmol/L
- LDL: 1.6 mmol/L (well below target)
- HDL: 1.7 mmol/L
- Triglycerides: 1.0 mmol/L

### Assessment
1. Hypertension — excellent control on current dual therapy. BP consistently at or below target of <130/80. No medication changes needed.
2. Dyslipidemia — excellent control on atorvastatin 40 mg. LDL 1.6 mmol/L, well below target. Lipid profile has progressively improved over 2 years with combined pharmacological and lifestyle intervention.
3. Glycemic status — normal. HbA1c 5.4%, pre-diabetes has fully resolved.
4. Left knee osteoarthritis — mild, early, medial compartment. Clinically improved with conservative management (topical NSAID, exercises, footwear, activity modification). X-ray confirms mild degenerative changes. No surgical intervention needed.
5. Perimenopause — likely approaching menopause (5 months amenorrhea). Vasomotor symptoms mild, managed conservatively. Will reassess if 12 months amenorrhea reached.
6. Weight management — excellent sustained progress. Total weight loss of 5.0 kg over 2 years (72.2 to 67.2 kg). BMI improved from 28.2 to 26.3.
7. Cardiovascular risk — overall risk profile has improved substantially since initial presentation in 2024. Normal stress test in 2025. All modifiable risk factors trending in the right direction.

### Plan
1. Renew all medications for 12 months:
   - Amlodipine 5 mg PO daily — Rx: 90 tablets, 3 repeats
   - Ramipril 5 mg PO daily — Rx: 90 tablets, 3 repeats
   - Atorvastatin 40 mg PO at bedtime — Rx: 90 tablets, 3 repeats
2. Continue vitamin D3 1000 IU daily (OTC).
3. Left knee: continue topical diclofenac as needed, quadriceps strengthening exercises, appropriate footwear. No referral to orthopedics needed at this time — reassess if symptoms worsen.
4. Perimenopause: track last menstrual period date. If vasomotor symptoms become bothersome, consider menopause hormone therapy at next visit. If 12 months amenorrhea confirmed, will label as post-menopausal.
5. Repeat fasting bloodwork (lipids, HbA1c, creatinine, potassium) at next annual physical in June 2026.
6. Continue home BP monitoring.
7. Preventive care: next FIT in 2027, next mammogram in 2027, next Pap in 2027.
8. Congratulated patient on outstanding progress over the past 2 years — significant improvements in blood pressure, cholesterol, weight, fitness, and overall cardiovascular risk profile.
