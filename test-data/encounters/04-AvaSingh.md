- Date: 2024-03-14
- Time: 10:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Windsor-Essex Family Health Team (1585 Ouellette Ave, Suite 100, Windsor, ON)

- Reason for visit: Iron deficiency follow-up and ferritin recheck

### Subjective

Ava Singh is a 15-year-old female presenting for follow-up of iron deficiency diagnosed three months ago after she reported persistent fatigue, difficulty concentrating in school, and occasional dizziness on standing. She was started on ferrous sulfate 300 mg PO daily at that time. She reports some improvement in her energy levels over the past several weeks, though she still feels more tired than her peers, particularly in the afternoons after school. She denies any frank dizziness or presyncope episodes since starting supplementation. She has been taking the iron tablet in the evening with a glass of orange juice as previously instructed. She reports occasional mild nausea after taking the tablet but no vomiting, abdominal cramping, or significant constipation. Stools have been darker, which she was forewarned about. No melena, hematochezia, or hematemesis. No pica or pagophagia. She is a lifelong vegetarian (lacto-ovo vegetarian family diet, cultural and personal preference). She does not eat meat, poultry, or fish. She reports eating eggs a few times per week, some lentils and chickpeas, and dairy daily. She acknowledges her vegetable and legume intake could be better. Menstrual history: menarche at age 13, cycles approximately every 28-30 days, duration 5-6 days, moderate flow with some clotting on day 2-3, using approximately 4-5 pads per day on heaviest days. She does not consider her periods excessively heavy. No intermenstrual bleeding. She is not sexually active. No weight loss or gain. No bruising or petechiae. No family history of bleeding disorders, thalassemia, or other hemoglobinopathies. No allergies to medications or foods. No other medications or supplements.

### Objective

- Vitals: BP 108/66 mmHg, HR 76 bpm, Temp 36.5 C, RR 16, SpO2 99% RA
- Height: 162 cm
- Weight: 55.3 kg
- BMI: 21.1 kg/m2
- General: Alert, well-appearing adolescent female, no pallor of conjunctivae or nail beds, no acute distress
- HEENT: Conjunctivae pink, no scleral icterus; oral mucosa moist, no glossitis or angular cheilitis
- Cardiovascular: S1S2 normal, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs (no flow murmur appreciated today)
- Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, no hepatosplenomegaly, normal bowel sounds
- Skin: No bruising, petechiae, or koilonychia
- Nails: No spooning

Labs (drawn 2024-03-07):
- CBC: WBC 6.8, Hgb 121 g/L (reference 120-160 g/L), MCV 78 fL (reference 80-100 fL), MCH 26.1 pg (reference 27.0-33.0 pg), RDW 15.2% (reference 11.5-14.5%), Plt 298
- Ferritin: 11 ug/L (reference 12-150 ug/L)
- Serum iron: 7 umol/L (reference 9-30 umol/L)
- TIBC: 72 umol/L (reference 45-72 umol/L)
- Transferrin saturation: 10% (reference 20-50%)

### Assessment

1. **Iron deficiency with borderline iron deficiency anemia** — ferritin remains low at 11 ug/L (below reference), hemoglobin borderline at 121 g/L with microcytic indices (MCV 78 fL, MCH 26.1 pg) and elevated RDW. Serum iron low with elevated TIBC and low transferrin saturation, all consistent with iron deficiency. The patient has been on ferrous sulfate 300 mg daily for approximately three months with subjective improvement in fatigue but insufficient biochemical response. Contributing factors include vegetarian diet with suboptimal non-heme iron sources and menstrual iron losses in an adolescent female. Compliance appears good but absorption may be suboptimal; need to review timing relative to meals and any dietary inhibitors.
2. **Vegetarian diet — nutritional counselling warranted** — current intake is low in iron-rich plant foods. Needs targeted dietary guidance for optimizing non-heme iron intake and enhancing absorption.

### Plan

1. Continue ferrous sulfate 300 mg (60 mg elemental iron) PO daily. Reviewed administration: take on an empty stomach or 1 hour before meals when possible; continue pairing with vitamin C source (orange juice or 250 mg vitamin C tablet) to enhance absorption. Avoid taking within 2 hours of dairy products, calcium supplements, tea, coffee, or high-phytate foods (bran cereals) as these significantly inhibit iron absorption.
2. Discussed that her evening timing with orange juice is acceptable; however, if she is taking it right after dinner, the calcium from dairy at dinner may be interfering with absorption. Suggested taking the iron tablet at least 2 hours after the evening meal, or alternatively taking it mid-morning on an empty stomach if school schedule allows.
3. Dietary counselling provided:
   - Increase iron-rich plant foods: fortified breakfast cereals, lentils (red and green), chickpeas, kidney beans, tofu, spinach, pumpkin seeds, quinoa.
   - Pair iron-rich foods with vitamin C sources at each meal (bell peppers, tomatoes, citrus, strawberries, broccoli).
   - Avoid tea and coffee with meals (tannins inhibit iron absorption).
   - Consider cooking in cast iron cookware.
4. Discussed that iron repletion in the setting of ongoing menstrual losses and vegetarian diet may take 4-6 months. Target ferritin >30 ug/L before considering dose reduction.
5. Recheck CBC and ferritin in 3-4 months to assess response.
6. If ferritin fails to improve on next check, will consider increasing to twice-daily dosing or alternate-day dosing regimen, and may revisit for possible GI absorption issues.
7. Menstrual flow does not sound excessive at present; no indication for further workup of menorrhagia at this time.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: 3-4 months for ferritin and CBC recheck (target July 2024)
- Referrals: None

- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Windsor-Essex Family Health Team (1585 Ouellette Ave, Suite 100, Windsor, ON)
- Practitioner: Dr. David Fung, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-63921)
- Reason for visit: Annual physical examination and adolescent well-visit, iron deficiency follow-up

### Subjective

Ava presents for her annual physical examination and routine adolescent well-visit. She also has outstanding bloodwork from July to review. She reports feeling significantly better than at her last visit in March. Her energy levels have improved noticeably and she no longer feels the afternoon fatigue that was troubling her earlier in the year. She has been more active — she joined her school's cross-country running team in September and has been tolerating training well without excessive fatigue or dizziness. She continues to take ferrous sulfate 300 mg daily, now taking it mid-morning at school on an empty stomach with a vitamin C tablet (250 mg) as discussed. She reports the nausea has largely resolved with this timing. No constipation. She has made dietary changes as recommended: eating fortified cereal most mornings, having lentil-based meals 3-4 times per week, and her mother has started using a cast iron pan for cooking. She continues to avoid tea with meals. Menstrual cycles remain regular, every 28-30 days, duration 5-6 days, moderate flow. She does not feel her periods have changed. No intermenstrual or postcoital bleeding. She confirms she is not sexually active. No mood concerns — she describes her mood as generally good, school is going well, she has a supportive friend group. Sleep is adequate at 8-9 hours on school nights. No substance use (tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, or other drugs). No concerns about body image or disordered eating. She wears her seatbelt. She denies any history of bullying or safety concerns at home or school. No new medications, supplements, or allergies. Family history unchanged — parents and one younger sibling are well. She is up to date on immunizations per Ontario schedule; received HPV vaccine series (Gardasil-9) and meningococcal ACWY in grade 7.

### Objective

- Vitals: BP 110/68 mmHg, HR 72 bpm, Temp 36.5 C, RR 14, SpO2 99% RA
- Height: 163 cm
- Weight: 56.1 kg
- BMI: 21.1 kg/m2
- Growth: Height and weight tracking along the 50th percentile, consistent with prior measurements; growth velocity appropriate for age
- General: Well-appearing, healthy adolescent female, no pallor, no acute distress
- HEENT: Conjunctivae pink, oropharynx clear, no lymphadenopathy, thyroid normal
- Cardiovascular: S1S2 normal, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs
- Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, no hepatosplenomegaly
- Musculoskeletal: Normal gait, no scoliosis on Adam's forward bend test, spine straight
- Skin: No bruising, rashes, or lesions; no acne of concern
- Tanner staging: Tanner V breast and pubic hair — developmentally appropriate for age

Labs (drawn 2024-07-18):
- CBC: WBC 6.2, Hgb 128 g/L (reference 120-160 g/L), MCV 82 fL (reference 80-100 fL), MCH 27.4 pg (reference 27.0-33.0 pg), RDW 14.2% (reference 11.5-14.5%), Plt 271
- Ferritin: 18 ug/L (reference 12-150 ug/L)
- Serum iron: 11 umol/L (reference 9-30 umol/L)
- TIBC: 64 umol/L (reference 45-72 umol/L)
- Transferrin saturation: 17% (reference 20-50%)

### Assessment

1. **Iron deficiency — improving** — ferritin has risen from 11 to 18 ug/L over approximately 4 months. Hemoglobin improved from 121 to 128 g/L. MCV has normalized at 82 fL. RDW trending down. Transferrin saturation still slightly low at 17% but improved. These trends are encouraging and indicate the supplementation and dietary changes are having a positive effect. Ferritin remains below target of 30 ug/L, so continued supplementation is warranted. The slower-than-expected repletion rate is consistent with ongoing menstrual losses and reliance on non-heme iron sources.
2. **Adolescent well-visit** — developmentally appropriate, no concerns on HEADSS screening. Growth parameters stable. Immunizations up to date. Active in sports. Good mental health and social supports. Vegetarian diet with improving nutritional quality.
3. **Routine health maintenance** — no screening concerns. Scoliosis screen negative. Up to date on vaccinations.

### Plan

1. Continue ferrous sulfate 300 mg PO daily with vitamin C. Current regimen and timing are working well — maintain.
2. Reinforced dietary counselling: praised the changes she has made (fortified cereal, increased legumes, cast iron cookware). Encouraged continued optimization and variety of iron-rich plant foods.
3. Discussed that ferritin target is at least 30 ug/L, ideally 50 ug/L for an active adolescent with ongoing menstrual losses. At current trajectory, anticipate reaching target in the next 4-6 months if compliance and dietary changes continue.
4. With cross-country running, discussed the additional importance of adequate iron stores for endurance athletes. Iron deficiency without anemia can still impair exercise performance and recovery.
5. Recheck CBC and ferritin in 6 months (approximately March 2025).
6. Reviewed adolescent anticipatory guidance: safe sport participation, nutrition for athletes, importance of sleep, mental health awareness.
7. Discussed Ontario immunization schedule — no vaccines due at this visit. Meningococcal B vaccine discussed; family will consider (not publicly funded in Ontario, available through pharmacy or travel clinic at patient's expense).
8. No concerns regarding menstrual history at this time; continue to monitor. If periods become heavier or more prolonged, would reassess.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: 6 months for ferritin recheck and iron review (target March 2025)
- Referrals: None

### Subjective

Ava returns for her scheduled iron follow-up. She reports feeling well with good energy levels. She has been running consistently through the winter on her school's indoor track team and has not experienced exercise-limiting fatigue. She is sleeping well and her academic performance is strong (honour roll). She continues ferrous sulfate 300 mg daily with a vitamin C tablet mid-morning. She has had no GI side effects — no nausea, constipation, or abdominal discomfort. She continues her improved vegetarian diet: fortified cereal most mornings, lentils or chickpeas 4-5 times per week, tofu once or twice per week, and eggs 3-4 times per week. Her mother continues to use cast iron cookware regularly. She avoids tea and coffee with meals. She has been trying to add pumpkin seeds as a snack, which she enjoys. Menstrual cycles remain regular at 28-30 days, 5-6 days duration, moderate flow unchanged. She reports her periods may be very slightly lighter than a year ago but is not certain. She is not sexually active. No new symptoms, no dizziness, no pica. No bruising or bleeding. No new medications, supplements, or allergies. She asks whether she will need to stay on the iron pills long-term.

### Objective

- Vitals: BP 110/70 mmHg, HR 68 bpm, Temp 36.4 C, RR 14, SpO2 99% RA
- Height: 163 cm
- Weight: 56.4 kg
- BMI: 21.2 kg/m2

- Nails: No koilonychia, no brittleness

Labs (drawn 2025-03-13):
- CBC: WBC 5.9, Hgb 133 g/L (reference 120-160 g/L), MCV 84 fL (reference 80-100 fL), MCH 28.2 pg (reference 27.0-33.0 pg), RDW 13.8% (reference 11.5-14.5%), Plt 256
- Ferritin: 24 ug/L (reference 12-150 ug/L)
- Serum iron: 14 umol/L (reference 9-30 umol/L)
- TIBC: 58 umol/L (reference 45-72 umol/L)
- Transferrin saturation: 24% (reference 20-50%)

### Assessment

1. **Iron deficiency — continued improvement** — ferritin has improved from 11 ug/L (March 2024) to 18 ug/L (July 2024) to 24 ug/L (March 2025). Hemoglobin now 133 g/L (up from 121 one year ago), MCV 84 fL (normalized), RDW normalizing at 13.8%. Transferrin saturation has improved to 24%, now within normal range. All iron studies trending favourably. Ferritin remains below ideal target of 50 ug/L for an active menstruating adolescent, but has crossed the 20 ug/L threshold and the rate of improvement is steady. Continue supplementation to build stores further.
2. **Vegetarian diet — adequate nutritional management** — patient and family have made excellent sustained dietary changes. Non-heme iron intake has improved substantially.

### Plan

1. Continue ferrous sulfate 300 mg PO daily with vitamin C. Discussed her question about duration: explained that given her ongoing menstrual iron losses and vegetarian diet, she is at higher risk for recurrence if supplementation is stopped prematurely. Goal is to achieve a ferritin of at least 50 ug/L before considering a trial off supplementation. At current trajectory, this may take another 6-9 months. At that point, will consider reducing to every-other-day dosing or dietary sources alone, with monitoring.
2. Reviewed emerging evidence that alternate-day iron dosing may be as effective as daily dosing with fewer GI side effects and potentially better fractional absorption. Since she is tolerating daily dosing well, will continue current regimen. May transition to alternate-day dosing once ferritin reaches target, as a maintenance strategy.
3. Further dietary counselling:
   - Praised excellent adherence to dietary changes — continue current approach.
   - Discussed additional plant-based iron sources: edamame, dark chocolate (in moderation), dried apricots, fortified plant-based milks.
   - Discussed that as she continues to grow and is active in sports, caloric and protein intake should be sufficient. No concerns about inadequacy at present.
4. Discussed vitamin B12 briefly — as a lacto-ovo vegetarian, her risk of B12 deficiency is lower than for vegans, but worth monitoring periodically, especially if she ever transitions to a vegan diet. Not indicated to check today as she consumes eggs and dairy regularly.
5. Recheck CBC and ferritin in 6-7 months (approximately October 2025), to coincide with her annual physical.
6. Menstrual history stable and unremarkable — continue to monitor.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: 6-7 months for annual physical and ferritin recheck (target October 2025)
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 4: 2025-10-16 — Annual Physical / Iron Status Review

- Date: 2025-10-16
- Time: 11:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Windsor-Essex Family Health Team (1585 Ouellette Ave, Suite 100, Windsor, ON)
- Practitioner: Dr. David Fung, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-63921)
- Reason for visit: Annual physical examination and iron status review

### Subjective

Ava presents for her annual physical and iron follow-up. She is now 17 years old and in grade 12. She reports feeling very well overall — her energy is excellent, she has had no fatigue or dizziness, and she feels she is performing at her best both academically and athletically. She ran cross-country again this fall and also participated in track and field in the spring (800 m and 1500 m events). She has not experienced any exercise intolerance. She continues ferrous sulfate 300 mg daily with vitamin C mid-morning and tolerates it without any issues. Diet remains good: she has maintained her iron-rich vegetarian eating pattern with fortified cereals, legumes, tofu, eggs, seeds, and cast iron cooking. She and her family are committed to maintaining the vegetarian diet long-term. Menstrual cycles remain regular every 28-30 days, 5 days duration, moderate flow. She feels her periods have been slightly lighter over the past year compared to when she was younger. She is not sexually active. She denies any mood concerns, sleep disturbance, substance use, or safety concerns. She is planning to attend university next year (considering Western or McMaster for health sciences) and has some normal anticipatory stress about applications but is managing well. Sleep is 8-9 hours nightly. She has a supportive family and friend group. No new medications or allergies. Family history unchanged — no hemoglobinopathies, celiac disease, or bleeding disorders in the family.

### Objective

- Vitals: BP 112/68 mmHg, HR 70 bpm, Temp 36.5 C, RR 14, SpO2 99% RA
- Height: 163 cm
- Weight: 56.8 kg
- BMI: 21.4 kg/m2
- Growth: Height stable (completed growth), weight appropriate and stable
- General: Well-appearing, healthy, athletic adolescent female, excellent colour, no pallor, no acute distress
- HEENT: Conjunctivae pink, oropharynx clear, no lymphadenopathy, thyroid normal
- Cardiovascular: S1S2 normal, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs
- Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, no hepatosplenomegaly
- Musculoskeletal: Normal gait, no scoliosis, full range of motion in all limbs
- Skin: No bruising, rashes, or lesions
- Mental health screen: PHQ-2 score 0/6 (negative)

Labs (drawn 2025-10-09):
- CBC: WBC 6.1, Hgb 136 g/L (reference 120-160 g/L), MCV 86 fL (reference 80-100 fL), MCH 29.0 pg (reference 27.0-33.0 pg), RDW 13.2% (reference 11.5-14.5%), Plt 242
- Ferritin: 34 ug/L (reference 12-150 ug/L)
- Serum iron: 16 umol/L (reference 9-30 umol/L)
- TIBC: 54 umol/L (reference 45-72 umol/L)
- Transferrin saturation: 30% (reference 20-50%)

### Assessment

1. **Iron deficiency — substantially improved, approaching repletion** — ferritin now 34 ug/L, up from 11 ug/L at initial presentation in March 2024. Hemoglobin 136 g/L (well within normal range), MCV and MCH fully normalized, RDW normalized at 13.2%. All iron studies now within normal limits. Transferrin saturation 30%, normal. Excellent response to 19 months of daily ferrous sulfate 300 mg combined with significant dietary optimization. Ferritin has not yet reached ideal target of 50 ug/L for an active menstruating adolescent, but the improvement trajectory is very encouraging and all indices are now biochemically normal.
2. **Vegetarian diet — well managed** — patient and family have successfully adapted diet to support iron intake. Sustained, long-term changes in place.
3. **Adolescent well-visit** — healthy, developmentally appropriate 17-year-old. HEADSS screening unremarkable. PHQ-2 negative. Active, socially engaged, academically strong. No concerns.
4. **Transition planning** — patient will be leaving for university next year. Will need to establish care in new city. Important to ensure she understands her iron management independently.

### Plan

1. Given the excellent trend and normalization of all iron indices, transition from daily to alternate-day dosing: ferrous sulfate 300 mg PO every other day with vitamin C. This will help maintain stores while reducing pill burden and is supported by recent evidence suggesting comparable efficacy for maintenance with improved fractional absorption.
2. Continue for at least 3-4 more months on alternate-day dosing. If ferritin reaches 50 ug/L at next check, may consider a trial of dietary iron alone with ongoing monitoring.
3. If at any point she develops fatigue, exercise intolerance, or other symptoms suggestive of recurrent deficiency, resume daily dosing and reassess.
4. Dietary counselling reinforced:
   - Praised her sustained dietary improvements — she is an excellent example of successful nutritional management.
   - Discussed importance of maintaining these dietary habits when she moves to university and may be eating more independently (meal hall, cooking for herself). Reviewed practical strategies: choosing iron-fortified cereals, keeping canned lentils and chickpeas on hand, pairing plant-based iron with vitamin C at meals.
   - Avoid excessive tea or coffee with meals (common in university settings).
5. Recheck CBC and ferritin in 4-5 months (approximately February-March 2026). This will assess response to alternate-day dosing and help determine if she can transition to dietary sources alone before she leaves for university.
6. Discussed transition of care: when she moves for university, she should register with a family physician or university health services. Provided summary of her iron deficiency history and management for her records. Advised she should inform her new provider that she is a vegetarian with a history of iron deficiency and will need periodic ferritin monitoring (annually at minimum).
7. Immunizations reviewed — up to date per Ontario schedule. No vaccines due today.
8. Anticipatory guidance for transition to young adulthood: discussed responsible health management, importance of continuing to advocate for her own health, accessing mental health resources at university if needed, nutrition, safe practices.

### Disposition

- Follow-up: 4-5 months for ferritin recheck (target February-March 2026); earlier if symptomatic
- Referrals: None
