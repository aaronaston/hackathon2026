### Assessment
1. Prediabetes — A1c 6.0%, up from 5.9% one year ago. Fasting glucose 6.0 mmol/L, at the upper limit of normal. Strong family history of Type 2 diabetes (mother, maternal grandmother). BMI 27.9, overweight. Patient has risk factors warranting structured intervention per Diabetes Canada Clinical Practice Guidelines: family history, South Asian ethnicity (higher metabolic risk at lower BMI thresholds), and sedentary occupational lifestyle.
2. Overweight — BMI 27.9. Weight 72.4 kg. Waist circumference not measured today; to be assessed at next visit.
3. Cardiovascular risk — Framingham Risk Score calculated at low (< 10%) at current age and lipid profile. LDL 2.8 mmol/L is acceptable. No indication for statin at this time.
4. Health maintenance — up to date on cervical screening. Influenza vaccine given in fall 2023. COVID-19 boosters up to date.

### Plan
1. Structured lifestyle modification program — discussed the Ontario Diabetes Prevention Program (ODPP) and the importance of achieving 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity and 5–7% body weight reduction (target weight approximately 68–69 kg) per Diabetes Canada guidelines for prediabetes management.
2. Referral to registered dietitian at the Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team for culturally appropriate nutrition counselling, with focus on glycemic index, portion control, and reducing refined carbohydrates and added sugars.
3. Encouraged replacing white rice with brown rice or alternatives, reducing sugar in chai, and increasing vegetable and fibre intake.
4. No pharmacotherapy initiated at this time — lifestyle modification is first-line for prediabetes per Diabetes Canada.
5. Repeat A1c in 6 months (target September/October 2024) to monitor trend.
6. Fasting glucose and A1c to be monitored every 6 months while in prediabetes range.
7. Discussed the importance of early intervention — with current trajectory and family history, progression to Type 2 diabetes is a realistic risk without sustained behaviour change.
8. Requisition provided for A1c and fasting glucose for September 2024.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 6 months for A1c follow-up (September 2024)
- Referrals: Registered dietitian at Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team

- Date: 2024-09-10
- Time: 14:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton)
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Six-month A1c follow-up and lifestyle modification reassessment

### Subjective
Ms. Iyer returns for her prediabetes follow-up. She reports she met with the registered dietitian twice over the summer and has been making gradual dietary changes. She has reduced her white rice intake by approximately half, substituting with brown rice and quinoa several days per week. She has cut sugar in her chai from two teaspoons to one. She notes she has also started walking 30 minutes after dinner four to five evenings per week and has begun a beginner yoga class at the Whitby Recreation Centre once per week. She estimates she is achieving approximately 120–130 minutes of moderate activity per week, up from roughly 60 minutes previously.

She reports feeling more energetic overall. She has noticed her clothes are fitting somewhat more loosely. No polyuria, polydipsia, blurred vision, or numbness. No new symptoms. No allergies. No medications.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 120/76 mmHg, HR 72 bpm
- Weight: 71.2 kg, BMI: 27.5 kg/m2 (down 1.2 kg from April 2024)
- Waist circumference: 86 cm (elevated; target < 80 cm for women of South Asian descent per Diabetes Canada)

Lab results (drawn 2024-09-03):
- HbA1c: 5.9% (previous 6.0% in April 2024)
- Fasting glucose: 5.8 mmol/L (previous 6.0 mmol/L)

### Assessment
1. Prediabetes — A1c improved from 6.0% to 5.9%. Fasting glucose improved from 6.0 to 5.8 mmol/L. These are modest but encouraging improvements consistent with lifestyle modifications. Patient is trending in the right direction. Remains in the prediabetes range (A1c 5.7–6.4%). No progression toward diabetes threshold.
2. Overweight — weight down 1.2 kg over 5 months (1.7% body weight reduction). Target is 5–7% reduction. Waist circumference 86 cm remains above the recommended threshold of < 80 cm for women of South Asian descent. Continued effort required.
3. Lifestyle modifications — patient is making meaningful changes but has not yet reached the 150 minutes/week exercise target. Diet improvements are commendable.

### Plan
1. Positive reinforcement — congratulated patient on A1c improvement and dietary changes. Encouraged continued effort.
2. Exercise goal — discussed strategies to bridge the gap from current 120–130 minutes/week to the 150 minutes/week target. Suggested adding a brisk 20-minute walk during lunch break 2–3 times per week or increasing weekend activity.
3. Continue working with registered dietitian — encouraged further sessions to refine meal planning.
4. Discussed the Ontario Diabetes Prevention Program (ODPP) — patient interested in learning more. Provided information on local community-based programs available through the Hamilton and Whitby YMCA partnerships.
5. No pharmacotherapy at this time.
6. Repeat A1c in 6 months (March 2025). Requisition provided.
7. Next visit to be with NP Sandra Fleming in January 2025 for interim weight management and nutrition counselling follow-up.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: January 2025 (NP visit for weight management / nutrition counselling); March 2025 (A1c recheck)
- Referrals: Ontario Diabetes Prevention Program (ODPP) — community-based lifestyle intervention

## Encounter 3: 2025-01-14 — NP Visit: Weight Management / Nutrition Counselling

- Date: 2025-01-14
- Time: 11:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton)
- Practitioner: NP Sandra Fleming, MN NP-PHC (ON-NP-50312)
- Reason for visit: Interim follow-up for weight management and nutrition counselling in context of prediabetes

### Subjective
Ms. Iyer presents for an interim visit with the nurse practitioner to review her progress with lifestyle modifications. She reports she enrolled in the Ontario Diabetes Prevention Program (ODPP) through the Hamilton YMCA in October 2024 and has been attending the group sessions every two weeks. She has found the group setting motivating and has learned new strategies for meal planning, portion control, and managing holiday eating. She notes the holiday season (November–December) was challenging — she gained approximately 1 kg, which she attributes to festive meals and reduced physical activity during the cold weather.

She has since resumed her walking routine (now using the indoor track at the Whitby Recreation Centre) and continues her weekly yoga class. She estimates she is now achieving 130–140 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week. She reports that she has replaced sugar in her chai with a small amount of honey and is trying to reduce overall sweetened beverage intake. She drinks water and unsweetened green tea throughout the day. She has incorporated more lentils, chickpeas, and vegetables into her meals, reducing overall rice portion sizes.

No new symptoms. No polyuria, polydipsia, blurred vision, or numbness. No allergies. No medications.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 118/74 mmHg, HR 70 bpm
- Weight: 71.8 kg, BMI: 27.7 kg/m2 (up 0.6 kg from September 2024; slight holiday rebound)
- Waist circumference: 85 cm (slight improvement from 86 cm in September 2024)

No laboratory investigations ordered at this visit — A1c scheduled for March 2025 per Dr. Moreau's plan.

### Assessment
1. Prediabetes — currently managed with lifestyle modifications. Patient is actively engaged in the ODPP and making sustainable dietary and exercise changes. Minor weight rebound over the holiday period is common and not concerning. Overall trajectory remains positive.
2. Overweight — weight 71.8 kg, BMI 27.7. Net change from baseline (April 2024): down 0.6 kg (0.8% body weight reduction). Waist circumference modestly improved (86 to 85 cm). Patient has not yet reached the 5–7% weight loss target. This is a long-term goal and continued steady progress is appropriate.
3. Physical activity — approaching but not yet consistently achieving 150 minutes/week. Barrier identified: cold weather limiting outdoor walking. Patient has adapted by using indoor facilities, which is a positive coping strategy.

### Plan
1. Encouraged continued participation in the ODPP group sessions.
2. Discussed SMART goal-setting for physical activity: specific target of 150 minutes/week by April 2025, incorporating three 30-minute walks and two 30-minute yoga or indoor cycling sessions per week.
3. Nutrition counselling:
   - Reviewed food diary entries from the past two weeks. Identified opportunities to further reduce evening snacking and control dinner portion sizes.
   - Encouraged continued high-fibre, low-glycemic-index food choices.
   - Discussed mindful eating practices to reduce overeating during social and family meals.
4. Provided handout on glycemic index of common South Asian foods developed by the Hamilton Mountain FHT dietitian.
5. No pharmacotherapy at this time.
6. Lab requisition for A1c and fasting glucose already provided — to be drawn early March 2025 prior to next physician visit.
7. Advised patient to schedule follow-up with Dr. Moreau in May 2025 for A1c review and reassessment.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: May 2025 with Dr. Moreau for A1c follow-up
- Referrals: None new (continuing with ODPP and FHT dietitian)

## Encounter 4: 2025-05-06 — A1c Follow-up with Family Physician

- Date: 2025-05-06
- Time: 09:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton)
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: A1c follow-up and prediabetes management reassessment

### Subjective
Ms. Iyer returns for her scheduled A1c follow-up. She reports she has been consistent with her lifestyle changes over the past several months. She has been attending the ODPP group sessions and completed 10 of the 16 core sessions. She reports achieving 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity most weeks since late March 2025, incorporating a combination of brisk walking (30 minutes, 4–5 times per week) and yoga (once per week). With spring weather, she has returned to outdoor walking in her Whitby neighbourhood.

She notes her weight has been gradually trending down and that she has had to tighten her belt by one notch. She has continued her dietary modifications and reports that her family has largely adopted the same eating changes, which makes adherence easier. She has eliminated sugar from her chai entirely and switched to brown rice for most meals.

No polyuria, polydipsia, blurred vision, or numbness. No new symptoms. She asks whether her numbers have improved enough to be considered "out of the prediabetes zone." No allergies. No medications.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 118/72 mmHg, HR 68 bpm
- Weight: 70.6 kg, BMI: 27.2 kg/m2 (down from 71.8 kg in January 2025; total loss of 1.8 kg since April 2024, representing 2.5% body weight reduction)
- Waist circumference: 83 cm (down from 85 cm in January 2025)

Lab results (drawn 2025-04-28):
- HbA1c: 5.8% (previous 5.9% in September 2024)
- Fasting glucose: 5.6 mmol/L (previous 5.8 mmol/L)

### Assessment
1. Prediabetes — A1c 5.8%, improved from 5.9%. Fasting glucose 5.6 mmol/L, improved from 5.8 mmol/L. Continued favourable trend. Patient remains in prediabetes range (A1c 5.7–6.4%) but is approaching the lower threshold. Discussed with patient that she is not yet "out of the zone" but that her trajectory is very encouraging and continued lifestyle efforts are key.
2. Overweight — BMI 27.2, weight 70.6 kg. Total weight loss from baseline of 1.8 kg (2.5%). Waist circumference improved from 86 cm (September 2024) to 83 cm. Still above the South Asian-specific target of < 80 cm but trending well. Patient has not yet reached the 5–7% weight loss target but is making steady progress.
3. Cardiovascular risk — remains low. Lipid panel to be repeated at annual physical in October 2025.
4. Physical activity — patient is now consistently meeting the 150 minutes/week target per Diabetes Canada guidelines. This represents an important milestone.

### Plan
1. Congratulated patient on reaching 150 minutes/week of physical activity and on continued A1c improvement. Reinforced that sustained effort over years is what prevents progression to diabetes.
2. Continue current lifestyle modifications — diet, exercise, ODPP participation.
3. Discussed potential for further weight loss to the 5–7% target (goal weight approximately 67–68 kg). Encouraged patience and consistency rather than rapid dieting.
4. No pharmacotherapy indicated — lifestyle modification continues to be effective.
5. Next comprehensive assessment: annual physical in October 2025. Will include full metabolic panel, lipid panel, A1c, fasting glucose, and cardiovascular risk reassessment.
6. Requisition provided for labs to be drawn 1 week prior to October appointment.
7. Continue ODPP — patient is motivated to complete the remaining core sessions and transition to the maintenance phase.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: October 2025 for annual physical and prediabetes screening
- Referrals: None

- Time: 10:15
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton)
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Annual health examination and prediabetes monitoring

### Subjective
Ms. Iyer presents for her annual physical examination. She reports feeling well and is pleased with her progress over the past year. She completed all 16 core sessions of the Ontario Diabetes Prevention Program and has transitioned to the monthly maintenance sessions. She has maintained her exercise routine of approximately 150–160 minutes per week, consisting of brisk walking, yoga, and occasional swimming at the Whitby Recreation Centre. She has sustained her dietary changes and reports that these have become habitual rather than effortful.

She notes her weight has been relatively stable since the spring. She has had no episodes of illness since her last visit. No polyuria, polydipsia, blurred vision, numbness, or tingling. No chest pain or dyspnea. Menstrual cycles regular. She received her influenza vaccine at a pharmacy in September 2025. COVID-19 boosters are up to date.

Lab results (drawn 2025-10-14):
- HbA1c: 5.8% (stable from May 2025)
- Fasting glucose: 5.5 mmol/L (improved from 5.6 mmol/L)
- Creatinine: 60 umol/L, eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73m2
- Urine ACR: 0.8 mg/mmol (normal < 2.0)
- Total cholesterol: 4.6 mmol/L, LDL 2.5 mmol/L, HDL 1.5 mmol/L, TG 1.3 mmol/L
- TSH: 2.2 mIU/L
- CBC: within normal limits
- ALT: 18 U/L

Preventive health:
- Cervical screening: Pap test done today (due per Ontario screening interval)
- Breast screening: Not yet indicated per Ontario Breast Screening Program (age 45)

### Assessment
1. Prediabetes — A1c stable at 5.8%, fasting glucose 5.5 mmol/L. Patient remains in the prediabetes range (A1c 5.7–6.4%) but is at the lower end. Trend over 18 months: A1c 6.0% to 5.8%, fasting glucose 6.0 to 5.5 mmol/L. Lifestyle modifications are having a sustained and measurable effect. No progression toward diabetes.
2. Overweight — BMI 27.1, weight 70.2 kg. Total weight loss of 2.2 kg (3.0% body weight reduction from April 2024 baseline). Waist circumference 82 cm — still above the South Asian-specific target of < 80 cm but improved by 4 cm since first measured. Patient has not reached the 5–7% weight loss target but the rate of loss is slow and sustainable.
3. Lipid profile — improved since April 2024. LDL 2.5 mmol/L (down from 2.8), HDL 1.5 mmol/L (up from 1.4), TG 1.3 mmol/L (down from 1.5). No indication for statin therapy given age, absence of diabetes, and low cardiovascular risk.
4. Renal function — normal. Urine ACR normal.
5. Health maintenance — Pap test done today. Influenza vaccine received September 2025. COVID-19 boosters up to date. Thyroid function normal.

### Plan
1. Continue lifestyle modifications — diet, exercise (150 minutes/week), and ODPP maintenance sessions.
2. Encouraged continued gradual weight loss toward the 5–7% target. Discussed that even 3% weight loss has been shown to reduce diabetes progression risk, so current progress is clinically meaningful.
3. No pharmacotherapy — patient continues to respond well to lifestyle intervention alone.
4. Repeat A1c and fasting glucose in 6 months (April 2026). Requisition provided.
5. Interim visit with NP Sandra Fleming in February 2026 for A1c check and exercise program review, given winter season.
6. Pap test results to be communicated by telephone.
7. Continue annual monitoring: A1c, fasting glucose, lipid panel, renal function, and urine ACR.
8. Discussed long-term outlook — with sustained effort, it is possible to return to normoglycemia (A1c < 5.7%) or at minimum prevent progression. Reinforced that prediabetes management is a marathon, not a sprint.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: February 2026 (NP visit for A1c check / exercise program review); April 2026 (A1c recheck with Dr. Moreau)
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 6: 2026-02-10 — NP Visit: A1c Check / Exercise Program Review

- Date: 2026-02-10
- Time: 13:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton)
- Practitioner: NP Sandra Fleming, MN NP-PHC (ON-NP-50312)
- Reason for visit: A1c check and exercise program review during winter months

### Subjective
Ms. Iyer presents for her scheduled interim visit with the nurse practitioner. She reports she has been doing well through the winter. She has maintained her indoor exercise routine using the Whitby Recreation Centre track and pool, supplemented by home-based yoga. She estimates she has been achieving 140–160 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week, though she acknowledges some weeks have been closer to 130 minutes due to an increased workload at her office. She states she is committed to returning to the higher end once her schedule stabilizes in March.

She has continued the dietary modifications that are now well established for her and her family. She mentions she attended the ODPP maintenance session in January and found it helpful for staying on track during the winter months when motivation can be lower. She has been trying a few new recipes with millet and barley that she learned about at the session.

She has no new symptoms. No polyuria, polydipsia, blurred vision, numbness, or tingling. No illness over the winter. She received her influenza vaccine in the fall. She asks about her latest lab results and whether she is getting closer to "normal."

No allergies. No medications. No procedures.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 118/74 mmHg, HR 68 bpm
- Weight: 70.6 kg, BMI: 27.2 kg/m2 (stable; minor fluctuation from 70.2 kg in October 2025)

Lab results (drawn 2026-02-03):
- HbA1c: 6.0% (previous 5.8% in October 2025)
- Fasting glucose: 5.7 mmol/L (previous 5.5 mmol/L)

### Assessment
1. Prediabetes — A1c 6.0%, up from 5.8% at the October 2025 annual physical. Fasting glucose 5.7 mmol/L, up from 5.5 mmol/L. This represents a minor uptick that is likely related to seasonal factors including reduced physical activity intensity during the winter months and potential dietary variability over the holiday season. The A1c remains well within the prediabetes range and has not approached the diabetes threshold (6.5%). Over the full trajectory since April 2024, A1c has ranged between 5.8% and 6.0%, indicating overall stable prediabetes without progression.
2. Overweight — weight 70.6 kg, BMI 27.2. Stable from the spring 2025 value. Total net weight loss from April 2024 baseline is 1.8 kg (2.5% body weight reduction). Waist circumference not formally measured today but patient reports her clothing fit has remained stable.
3. Physical activity — patient is approximately meeting the 150 minutes/week target on most weeks. Minor reduction in the winter is common and expected. The important finding is that she has developed sustainable habits and coping strategies (indoor exercise, home yoga) that prevent complete deconditioning during winter months.

Discussed with patient that the A1c fluctuation from 5.8% to 6.0% is not cause for alarm but is a reminder that vigilance is important, particularly during lower-activity seasons. The difference is small and can be influenced by day-to-day glycemic variability.

### Plan
1. Continue current lifestyle modifications — exercise, dietary management, ODPP maintenance sessions.
2. Exercise program review:
   - Current regimen: brisk walking (indoor track, 30 minutes, 4 times/week), yoga (1 time/week), occasional swimming.
   - Discussed adding a structured resistance training component 2 times per week (bodyweight exercises or light weights) per Diabetes Canada guidelines, which recommend combined aerobic and resistance exercise for optimal glycemic benefit.
   - Provided handout on beginner resistance exercises appropriate for home use.
   - Goal: 150 minutes/week aerobic activity plus 2 resistance sessions per week by April 2026.
3. Reviewed winter dietary patterns — encouraged maintaining high-fibre, low-glycemic-index choices and minimizing comfort food patterns during cold months.
4. No pharmacotherapy — current approach remains appropriate. Discussed that Metformin is considered as a pharmacologic option for prediabetes prevention in high-risk individuals (strong family history, A1c at higher end of prediabetes range, South Asian ethnicity) per Diabetes Canada guidelines, but at present the patient's A1c trend and active lifestyle engagement support continued non-pharmacologic management.
5. Next visit: April 2026 with Dr. Moreau for A1c recheck and reassessment. Lab requisition already provided at October visit.
6. If A1c trends upward at the April visit (6.1% or higher), will have a more detailed discussion with Dr. Moreau about intensifying intervention, potentially including Metformin consideration.
7. Reassured patient that her sustained commitment to lifestyle change over the past two years is the most effective strategy for preventing Type 2 diabetes, and that minor seasonal fluctuations do not negate her progress.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: April 2026 with Dr. Moreau for A1c follow-up and comprehensive reassessment
- Referrals: None
