- Date: 2024-03-19
- Time: 10:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton)
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Bilateral knee pain — osteoarthritis review and management discussion

### Subjective
Ms. Tran presents for review of her bilateral knee osteoarthritis, diagnosed in 2021 based on clinical presentation and radiographic findings. She reports gradual worsening of bilateral knee pain over the past several months, left worse than right. Pain is rated 5/10 at rest and 7/10 with prolonged walking, stair climbing, and rising from a seated position. She describes morning stiffness lasting approximately 15–20 minutes daily. She notes difficulty keeping up with her walking routine due to pain and stiffness. She has been using Acetaminophen 500 mg 1–2 tablets as needed, approximately 4–6 times per week, with modest relief. She has not tried topical agents. No joint swelling, locking, or giving way. No hip, back, or ankle pain. No constitutional symptoms.

She lives in Stratford, ON, and drives to Hamilton for her primary care appointments. She works part-time as a library assistant, which involves moderate standing and walking. She lives alone in a single-storey house.

Past medical history: Osteoarthritis of bilateral knees (diagnosed 2021). No surgical history.

Current medications: Acetaminophen 500 mg PO PRN (1–2 tablets, up to QID).

Allergies: No known drug allergies.

Social history: Non-smoker. Occasional alcohol (1–2 drinks per month). No recreational drugs. Lives alone. Independent with all ADLs but reports some difficulty with stairs and prolonged walking.

Family history: Mother with osteoarthritis (hips). Father with hypertension. No inflammatory arthritis in the family.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 128/78 mmHg, HR 74 bpm, RR 14, Temp 36.5°C, SpO2 98% RA
- Height: 158 cm, Weight: 66.8 kg, BMI: 26.8 kg/m²
- General: Well-appearing, ambulatory without assistive device, mild antalgic gait favouring left leg
- Musculoskeletal — bilateral knees:
  - Inspection: No gross deformity. Mild bilateral medial joint line prominence. No erythema or warmth. No significant effusion bilaterally.
  - Palpation: Tenderness along bilateral medial joint lines, left > right. Mild periarticular soft tissue thickening bilaterally. No popliteal cysts.
  - Range of motion: Right knee 0–125° (full extension, mildly reduced flexion). Left knee 0–115° (full extension, moderately reduced flexion). Crepitus palpable bilaterally with flexion/extension, more prominent on left.
  - Ligamentous stability: Varus/valgus stress testing stable bilaterally. Anterior and posterior drawer negative bilaterally.
  - McMurray test: Negative bilaterally.
  - Functional assessment: Able to rise from chair without arm support but with visible discomfort. Gait slightly antalgic on left.
- Lower extremity neurological: Sensation intact to light touch distally. Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses 2+ bilaterally.

WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index (self-reported):
- Pain subscale: 9/20
- Stiffness subscale: 4/8
- Physical function subscale: 24/68
- Total: 37/96 (moderate disability)

Previous imaging (referenced from 2021 chart): Bilateral knee X-rays (weight-bearing AP and lateral) — mild bilateral medial compartment joint space narrowing, small marginal osteophytes at medial tibial plateaus bilaterally. No loose bodies. No chondrocalcinosis. Kellgren-Lawrence Grade II bilaterally.

### Assessment
1. Bilateral knee osteoarthritis — progressive, primarily medial compartment, left worse than right. WOMAC score 37/96 indicating moderate functional impairment. Currently managed with PRN acetaminophen with suboptimal relief. Kellgren-Lawrence Grade II on previous imaging (2021). Clinical progression since last imaging likely.
2. Overweight — BMI 26.8. Weight management is a modifiable factor in OA progression and symptom burden.

### Plan
1. Continue Acetaminophen 500 mg, 1–2 tablets PO PRN, maximum 4 g/day. Counselled on avoiding combination products containing acetaminophen to prevent inadvertent overdose.
2. Add topical Diclofenac 1% gel (Voltaren Emulgel) — apply to bilateral knees TID–QID as needed. Discussed that topical NSAIDs are preferred over oral NSAIDs for knee OA as first-line adjunct per Canadian Rheumatology Association guidelines, given lower systemic risk profile. Available over the counter; OHIP does not cover topical NSAIDs but cost is modest.
3. Discussed intra-articular corticosteroid injection for the left knee, given that it is the more symptomatic side. Ms. Tran is interested but would like to try topical diclofenac first and reassess. Explained that injection can provide 4–12 weeks of relief; limit generally 3–4 injections per joint per year to avoid cartilage effects.
4. Weight management counselling — even modest weight loss of 5% body weight (approximately 3.3 kg) can meaningfully reduce knee load and OA symptoms. Referred to the FHT's registered dietitian for nutritional counselling.
5. Exercise prescription — recommended low-impact aerobic exercise (walking, swimming, stationary cycling) 30 minutes most days. Referred to the FHT physiotherapist for initial assessment and individualized quadriceps strengthening program, which is the cornerstone of non-pharmacological OA management.
6. Repeat bilateral knee X-rays (weight-bearing AP and lateral views) to assess interval change since 2021. Requisition provided for Hamilton Health Sciences imaging.
7. Follow-up in 6–8 weeks to review imaging, assess response to topical diclofenac, and reconsider injection if symptoms persist.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 6–8 weeks
- Referrals: Registered dietitian (Hamilton Mountain FHT); Physiotherapist (Hamilton Mountain FHT); Bilateral knee X-rays at Hamilton Health Sciences

## Encounter 2: 2024-05-14 — Intra-articular Corticosteroid Injection (Left Knee)

- Date: 2024-05-14
- Time: 09:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton)
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Left knee intra-articular corticosteroid injection for osteoarthritis

### Subjective
Ms. Tran returns for follow-up and planned left knee corticosteroid injection. She has been using topical Diclofenac 1% gel on bilateral knees for approximately 7 weeks. She reports partial improvement — the topical gel reduces pain from 7/10 to approximately 5/10 on the left and 5/10 to 3/10 on the right with activity. The right knee is now reasonably manageable with topical therapy and acetaminophen. The left knee remains significantly symptomatic, particularly with stair climbing and after prolonged standing at work. She rates her current left knee pain as 6/10 with activity, 4/10 at rest. Morning stiffness persists at 15–20 minutes.

She attended one session with the FHT physiotherapist and has started a home exercise program focusing on seated quadriceps sets, straight leg raises, and mini squats. She reports the exercises are tolerable but has not noticed symptom improvement yet. She has also seen the dietitian and is working on portion control and increasing vegetable intake. No weight change yet.

She has not had any adverse effects from topical diclofenac — no skin irritation or rash at application sites. Acetaminophen use continues at approximately 4–6 times per week. No gastrointestinal symptoms.

She reviewed the imaging results (see below) and would like to proceed with the injection as discussed at the last visit.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 126/76 mmHg, HR 72 bpm
- Weight: 66.5 kg, BMI: 26.6 kg/m²

Imaging results (performed 2024-04-22 at Hamilton Health Sciences):
Bilateral knee X-rays, weight-bearing AP and lateral:
- Left knee: Moderate medial compartment joint space narrowing with interval progression compared to 2021. Small-to-moderate marginal osteophytes at the medial tibial plateau and medial femoral condyle. Mild lateral compartment osteophytes. Mild patellofemoral osteophytes on lateral view. No loose bodies. No chondrocalcinosis. No fracture. Kellgren-Lawrence Grade II–III.
- Right knee: Mild medial compartment joint space narrowing, stable compared to 2021. Small marginal osteophytes at the medial tibial plateau. No loose bodies. No chondrocalcinosis. Kellgren-Lawrence Grade II, unchanged.

Pre-procedure left knee examination:
- Inspection: No erythema, warmth, or signs of infection at injection site. Small effusion palpable (positive patellar ballottement).
- Skin intact over medial and lateral approaches.

Injection procedure — left knee intra-articular corticosteroid:
- Consent: Informed consent obtained. Risks discussed including infection (< 1:10,000), post-injection flare (up to 10%), skin depigmentation, fat atrophy, and transient hyperglycemia. Benefits and expected duration of relief discussed.
- Approach: Superolateral approach, patient supine with left knee extended.
- Preparation: Skin prepped with chlorhexidine 2%. Sterile drape applied.
- Injection: 40 mg Methylprednisolone acetate (Depo-Medrol) mixed with 3 mL 1% Lidocaine without epinephrine. 22-gauge 1.5-inch needle inserted through the superolateral portal into the joint space. Slight resistance felt on entry, followed by loss of resistance confirming intra-articular placement. Approximately 2 mL of straw-coloured synovial fluid aspirated (non-bloody, clear) prior to injection. Injection administered without difficulty.
- Post-procedure: Needle withdrawn, puncture site covered with adhesive bandage. No immediate complications. Patient tolerated procedure well.

### Assessment
1. Bilateral knee osteoarthritis — left knee progressive, now Kellgren-Lawrence Grade II–III with moderate medial compartment narrowing and osteophyte formation, interval progression since 2021. Right knee stable at Grade II. Topical diclofenac providing partial relief. Left knee warranted intra-articular corticosteroid injection given persistent moderate-to-severe symptoms despite conservative measures.
2. Intra-articular corticosteroid injection — left knee — completed without complication. Aspirated fluid was non-inflammatory in appearance, consistent with osteoarthritis.

### Plan
1. Post-injection instructions provided:
   - Relative rest of the left knee for 24–48 hours. Avoid strenuous activity, prolonged standing, or heavy lifting for 48 hours.
   - May apply ice to the knee for 15–20 minutes every few hours if needed for post-injection soreness.
   - Mild post-injection flare (increased pain and swelling) may occur within the first 24–48 hours and typically self-resolves. Use acetaminophen for discomfort.
   - Seek immediate medical attention if redness, significant swelling, warmth, fever, or purulent drainage develops (signs of septic arthritis, though very rare).
2. Continue topical Diclofenac 1% gel to bilateral knees PRN.
3. Continue Acetaminophen 500 mg PRN.
4. Continue physiotherapy home exercise program — may resume exercises once post-injection soreness resolves, typically within 2–3 days.
5. Expected onset of benefit from injection: 3–7 days. Duration of relief variable, typically 4–12 weeks.
6. Follow-up in 3 months to assess injection response and ongoing management.
7. Discussed injection frequency limits — generally no more than 3–4 injections per joint per year. Repeated injections may be associated with accelerated cartilage loss. If injection provides only short-term relief, will discuss other options including orthopedic referral.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 3 months (August 2024)
- Referrals: None new

## Encounter 3: 2024-08-13 — Post-Injection Follow-up

- Date: 2024-08-13
- Time: 14:15
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton)
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Follow-up — response to left knee corticosteroid injection and osteoarthritis management

### Subjective
Ms. Tran returns 3 months after her left knee corticosteroid injection. She reports that the injection provided significant relief beginning approximately 5 days after the procedure. At peak effect (approximately 2–4 weeks post-injection), her left knee pain was 2/10 with activity and 0–1/10 at rest — the best it had been in over a year. She was able to walk for 30 minutes without significant discomfort and managed stairs much more easily.

However, she has noticed gradual return of symptoms over the past 3–4 weeks. Current left knee pain is 4/10 with activity and 2/10 at rest. She estimates the injection provided approximately 10 weeks of meaningful benefit. She is pleased with the result overall and asks about the possibility of repeating the injection.

Right knee remains manageable with topical diclofenac and acetaminophen — pain rated 2–3/10 with activity.

She has continued with her physiotherapy home exercises (quadriceps strengthening, range of motion) and reports that her legs feel stronger. She completed 4 sessions with the FHT physiotherapist and has been discharged to a home program. She has been walking regularly — 20–30 minutes, 4–5 times per week. She has lost 1.2 kg since her last visit.

She attended the dietitian appointment and has been making dietary changes. She feels the combination of exercise and dietary modification has been helpful overall but the knee pain remains the primary barrier to activity.

No adverse effects from the injection. No skin changes at the injection site. No new joint symptoms.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 124/76 mmHg, HR 70 bpm
- Weight: 65.3 kg, BMI: 26.2 kg/m² (down from 66.5 kg in May; total loss of 1.5 kg since March 2024)

- Left knee examination:
  - Inspection: No erythema, warmth, or effusion. No skin changes at injection site.
  - Palpation: Mild tenderness along medial joint line. Periarticular soft tissue thickening unchanged.
  - Range of motion: 0–120° (improved from 0–115° pre-injection; maintained despite symptom recurrence). Crepitus present but less prominent than baseline.
  - Functional: Rises from chair without difficulty. Gait non-antalgic today.
- Right knee examination:
  - No effusion. Mild medial joint line tenderness. Range of motion 0–125°, stable.

WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index (self-reported, today):
- Pain subscale: 6/20 (previously 9/20 in March 2024)
- Stiffness subscale: 3/8 (previously 4/8)
- Physical function subscale: 18/68 (previously 24/68)
- Total: 27/96 (mild-to-moderate disability; improved from 37/96)

### Assessment
1. Bilateral knee osteoarthritis — good response to left knee corticosteroid injection with approximately 10 weeks of significant relief. Symptoms now returning but remain improved from pre-injection baseline. WOMAC score improved from 37/96 to 27/96, reflecting meaningful functional gains. Right knee stable and manageable on conservative therapy.
2. Weight loss — 1.5 kg since March 2024 (from 66.8 to 65.3 kg). Positive trajectory. Each kilogram of body weight lost reduces knee joint load by approximately 4 kg with each step; this is clinically relevant for OA symptom management.
3. Exercise and physiotherapy — patient has been adherent to home program and reports improved strength. Continued exercise is the single most important non-pharmacological intervention for knee OA.

### Plan
1. Continue topical Diclofenac 1% gel to bilateral knees PRN.
2. Continue Acetaminophen 500 mg PRN (maximum 4 g/day).
3. Repeat left knee corticosteroid injection — discussed. Given that the first injection provided approximately 10 weeks of good relief, a second injection is reasonable. However, advised patient to wait until symptoms become more functionally limiting before repeating, to space injections appropriately (minimum 3-month interval between injections in the same joint). She can contact the office to schedule when she feels the benefit has fully worn off or symptoms warrant.
4. Continue home exercise program — quadriceps strengthening (straight leg raises, mini squats, wall sits), range of motion, and low-impact aerobic exercise. Encouraged progression of walking duration to 30 minutes daily.
5. Continue dietary modifications and weight loss efforts.
6. Discussed oral NSAIDs — if topical diclofenac becomes insufficient, short courses of oral Naproxen 250–500 mg BID with food may be considered. However, given her age (53) and desire to avoid systemic NSAID use, will reserve for flares. Counselled on GI and cardiovascular risks of chronic oral NSAID use. Would require gastroprotection with PPI if used regularly.
7. Follow-up in 5 months, or sooner if symptoms worsen and she wishes to repeat the injection.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 5 months (January 2025), or sooner for repeat injection
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 4: 2025-01-21 — OA Management and Weight/Exercise Review

- Date: 2025-01-21
- Time: 11:00
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton)
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Osteoarthritis management review, weight and exercise counselling

### Subjective
Ms. Tran presents for her scheduled OA follow-up. She reports that her left knee symptoms have gradually increased since the fall. Current left knee pain is 5/10 with activity (walking > 20 minutes, stair climbing) and 2–3/10 at rest. Morning stiffness is approximately 15 minutes. She has noticed more pain in cold weather and wonders if this is related. Right knee remains manageable at 2–3/10 with activity.

She has been using topical diclofenac regularly on both knees (TID to the left, BID to the right) and acetaminophen 1000 mg approximately once daily. She feels the topical gel and acetaminophen together keep her pain at a tolerable level but acknowledges it is not as well controlled as it was in the weeks following the injection.

She considered scheduling a repeat injection in the fall but decided to try managing conservatively through the winter. She asks about timing for a repeat injection now.

She has continued her home exercise program but admits her walking has decreased over the winter months due to cold weather and icy sidewalks. She has been doing indoor exercises (seated leg raises, wall sits) 3–4 times per week. She tried swimming at the Stratford YMCA once but found accessing the pool stairs uncomfortable on her knees.

Weight: She reports she has been stable since August. She has maintained the 1.5 kg loss but has not lost additional weight over the holidays. She feels motivated to resume more active exercise when the weather improves.

No new joint symptoms. No back pain. No falls. No fever, redness, or swelling of the joints suggesting inflammatory flare.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 130/80 mmHg, HR 76 bpm
- Weight: 65.8 kg, BMI: 26.4 kg/m² (slight increase from 65.3 kg in August; still below baseline of 66.8 kg)

- Left knee examination:
  - Inspection: No erythema, warmth. Trace effusion (equivocal patellar ballottement).
  - Palpation: Moderate medial joint line tenderness. Mild lateral joint line tenderness (new compared to August).
  - Range of motion: 0–118° (slight decrease from 0–120° in August). Crepitus bilaterally with flexion/extension.
  - Valgus stress: Stable. Varus stress: Stable. No instability.
- Right knee: Stable. Mild medial joint line tenderness. Range of motion 0–125°. No effusion.
- Gait: Mildly antalgic on left with first few steps, improves with walking.

Numeric Pain Rating Scale: Left knee 5/10 with activity, 2/10 at rest. Right knee 3/10 with activity.

### Assessment
1. Bilateral knee osteoarthritis — left knee symptoms have returned to pre-injection functional level, though WOMAC improvement from exercise and weight loss may still be partially sustained. Left knee shows trace effusion and new lateral joint line tenderness, suggesting possible progression of involvement beyond the medial compartment. Right knee stable.
2. Weight — essentially stable at 65.8 kg. Maintained the modest loss from 2024. Winter season and reduced activity may be contributing to plateau.
3. Exercise tolerance — reduced over winter due to weather and pain-related barriers. Indoor exercise has been maintained at reduced intensity.

### Plan
1. Repeat left knee intra-articular corticosteroid injection — discussed and patient agrees. The first injection was well tolerated and provided approximately 10 weeks of meaningful relief. It has been 8 months since the last injection, well within safe frequency limits. Injection scheduled for today.
   - Procedure performed: 40 mg Methylprednisolone acetate (Depo-Medrol) with 3 mL 1% Lidocaine, superolateral approach. Approximately 1.5 mL of clear straw-coloured synovial fluid aspirated. Injection completed without complication. Post-injection care instructions reviewed (same as May 2024).
2. Continue topical Diclofenac 1% gel to bilateral knees PRN.
3. Continue Acetaminophen 500 mg PRN, maximum 4 g/day. Counselled that current use of 1000 mg daily is well within safe limits.
4. Exercise — discussed importance of maintaining activity through winter. Recommended:
   - Stationary cycling (low resistance, high cadence) — excellent for knee OA as it provides aerobic conditioning and quadriceps activation with minimal joint impact.
   - Warm water aquafit classes if pool stair access can be managed (ladder entry may be easier than stairs at some facilities).
   - Continue seated and standing strengthening exercises at home.
   - Goal: 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity low-impact exercise per Canadian guidelines.
5. Weight management — reinforced that she has done well to maintain her loss. Encouraged her to aim for an additional 1–2 kg loss over the next 6 months, which would bring her total weight loss to approximately 5% of baseline — a threshold associated with meaningful symptom improvement in knee OA.
6. Discussed glucosamine and chondroitin — patient asked about supplements. Advised that current evidence does not support meaningful clinical benefit for OA symptom modification, per Canadian Rheumatology Association and Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) guidelines. Not harmful, but unlikely to provide significant improvement. Patient declines to start at this time.
7. If injection response is shorter or less effective than the first, will discuss orthopedic referral for further assessment including possible viscosupplementation or surgical consultation.
8. Follow-up in 5 months at annual physical.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 5 months (June 2025 — annual physical)
- Referrals: None

## Encounter 5: 2025-06-10 — Annual Physical / OA Review

- Date: 2025-06-10
- Time: 09:45
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton)
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Annual health examination and osteoarthritis review

### Subjective
Ms. Tran presents for her annual physical examination and ongoing OA management. She reports that the second corticosteroid injection (January 2025) provided good relief lasting approximately 8 weeks, which was slightly shorter than the first injection (10 weeks). She feels the peak benefit was comparable to the first injection (pain down to 2/10 with activity) but symptom return was somewhat faster. Current left knee pain is 4/10 with activity and 1–2/10 at rest. Right knee stable at 2–3/10 with activity.

She has been more physically active since the spring weather arrived. She walks 25–30 minutes, 5 days per week. She started a gentle yoga class in Stratford once per week, which she feels has helped with flexibility and balance. She continues her quadriceps strengthening exercises at home 3–4 times per week. She has lost an additional 1 kg since January.

She is using topical diclofenac on the left knee BID–TID and on the right knee once daily. Acetaminophen use is approximately 500–1000 mg on days with more activity. No gastrointestinal symptoms. No skin reactions from topical diclofenac.

She reports no other health concerns. Menopause: she notes her menstrual periods have become irregular over the past year — cycles ranging from 28 to 45 days. Occasional mild hot flashes, primarily at night, not significantly bothersome. No vaginal dryness, mood changes, or sleep disturbance beyond mild hot flashes.

Review of systems: No chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations. No headaches or visual changes. No bowel or bladder symptoms. No skin concerns. No mood changes or depressive symptoms.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 126/78 mmHg, HR 72 bpm, RR 14, Temp 36.6°C, SpO2 98% RA
- Height: 158 cm, Weight: 64.8 kg, BMI: 26.0 kg/m² (down from 66.8 kg at baseline in March 2024; total loss 2.0 kg)
- General: Well-appearing, no acute distress
- HEENT: Pupils equal and reactive, oropharynx clear, no thyromegaly
- Cardiovascular: S1 S2 normal, no murmurs, peripheral pulses 2+ bilaterally
- Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly
- Breast examination: No masses, tenderness, or skin changes. No axillary lymphadenopathy. Mammography screening initiated — patient turning 53, eligible under Ontario Breast Screening Program (OBSP) for average-risk women aged 50–74.
- Musculoskeletal — bilateral knees:
  - Left: No erythema, warmth, or effusion. Medial and lateral joint line tenderness present. ROM 0–118°. Crepitus moderate. Stable to ligamentous testing.
  - Right: Mild medial joint line tenderness. ROM 0–125°. Mild crepitus. No effusion.
- Skin: No concerning lesions. No rashes.

Lab results (drawn 2025-06-03, annual screening):
- CBC: within normal limits
- Creatinine: 72 µmol/L, eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73m²
- Fasting glucose: 5.4 mmol/L (normal)
- Total cholesterol: 5.1 mmol/L, LDL 3.0 mmol/L, HDL 1.5 mmol/L, TG 1.3 mmol/L
- TSH: 2.4 mIU/L
- ALT: 18 U/L
- 25-hydroxyvitamin D: 62 nmol/L (sufficient; > 75 nmol/L optimal)

Preventive health:
- Mammography: Requisition for OBSP screening mammogram provided
- Cervical screening: Pap test done today (Ontario Cervical Screening Program, every 3 years age 25–69)
- Colorectal screening: FIT (fecal immunochemical test) kit provided — due per Ontario guidelines for average-risk adults aged 50–74
- Bone density: Not yet indicated (typically age 65 for average-risk women; earlier if risk factors)
- Immunizations: Influenza vaccine due in fall. COVID-19 booster up to date. Shingrix (herpes zoster) vaccine — discussed; recommended for adults ≥ 50. Patient will consider (not OHIP-covered; approximately $150–170 per dose × 2 doses).

### Assessment
1. Bilateral knee osteoarthritis — stable on current multimodal management. Second corticosteroid injection provided good but slightly shorter relief (8 weeks vs 10 weeks). Pattern of diminishing injection duration is common and may indicate need for escalation of management if trend continues. Current pain levels are tolerable (left 4/10 with activity, right 2–3/10). WOMAC not formally repeated today but patient reports functional improvement over the past year attributed to exercise, weight loss, and pharmacological management.
2. Weight loss — 2.0 kg total since baseline (66.8 to 64.8 kg, approximately 3% of body weight). Approaching the 5% target. Encouraging continued efforts.
3. Perimenopause — irregular cycles and mild vasomotor symptoms. Currently not requiring treatment. Will monitor.
4. Dyslipidemia — LDL 3.0 mmol/L. No cardiovascular risk factors beyond age. Framingham Risk Score estimated at low (< 10% 10-year risk). Lifestyle management appropriate. Will reassess if risk profile changes.
5. Vitamin D — 62 nmol/L. Suboptimal but not deficient. Supplementation recommended, particularly given osteoarthritis and approaching age for bone health considerations.
6. Health maintenance — mammography, cervical screening, colorectal screening addressed. Immunization review completed.

### Plan
1. Continue topical Diclofenac 1% gel to bilateral knees PRN.
2. Continue Acetaminophen 500 mg PRN, maximum 4 g/day.
3. Continue exercise program — walking, yoga, and home strengthening. Counselled to progress walking duration toward 30–40 minutes daily as tolerated.
4. Continue dietary modifications and weight loss efforts toward 5% total body weight loss target.
5. Start Vitamin D3 1000 IU PO daily — supplement through fall/winter minimum; year-round supplementation reasonable in Ontario given latitude and OA.
6. Injection strategy — may consider a third injection if symptoms worsen to functionally limiting levels. If the third injection provides less than 6 weeks of meaningful relief, will refer to orthopedics for further assessment.
7. Complete mammography screening, FIT test, and await Pap test results.
8. Shingrix vaccine — patient to decide; can be administered at pharmacy.
9. Follow-up in 5 months, or sooner if OA symptoms worsen and she wishes to discuss injection or referral.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 5 months (November 2025)
- Referrals: Ontario Breast Screening Program mammography; FIT for colorectal screening

## Encounter 6: 2025-11-18 — OA Worsening and Physiotherapy Referral

- Date: 2025-11-18
- Time: 10:30
- Type: Scheduled
- Setting: Family Health Team
- Organization: Hamilton Mountain Family Health Team (690 Upper James St, Suite 300, Hamilton)
- Practitioner: Dr. Hannah Moreau, MD CCFP (ON-PRAC-66043)
- Reason for visit: Left knee osteoarthritis — increasing symptoms, functional decline, physiotherapy referral discussion

### Subjective
Ms. Tran presents with worsening left knee symptoms over the past 6–8 weeks. She reports left knee pain now rated 6–7/10 with activity and 3/10 at rest, which is the worst it has been since before her first injection. She describes increased difficulty with stair climbing at work (library has a mezzanine level), prolonged walking (can now only manage 15 minutes before needing to stop), and rising from low chairs. Morning stiffness has increased to 25–30 minutes. She also reports new mild night pain in the left knee, which wakes her approximately 2–3 times per week — this is a new symptom. She has been sleeping with a pillow between her knees for comfort.

The right knee has also been somewhat more symptomatic — pain now 3–4/10 with activity (previously stable at 2–3/10). No night pain from the right knee.

She has increased her acetaminophen use to 1000 mg TID on most days. Topical diclofenac is being used TID to the left knee and BID to the right. She feels her current pain management is inadequate. She considered requesting a third injection but also wants to discuss whether she should see an orthopedic specialist.

She has been less active — her walking program has decreased from 25–30 minutes to 10–15 minutes due to pain. She has stopped yoga class because kneeling and certain floor positions are too painful. She is still doing some seated quadriceps exercises at home but less consistently. She has not gained weight but is frustrated that her functional decline is threatening her ability to exercise.

She reports no joint redness, warmth, or acute swelling. No locking or true mechanical catching. She has noticed occasional giving-way sensation in the left knee, particularly going down stairs — this concerns her.

She completed mammography screening (normal), FIT test (negative), and Pap test (normal). No perimenopausal symptom changes.

### Objective
- Vitals: BP 130/82 mmHg, HR 76 bpm
- Weight: 65.2 kg, BMI: 26.1 kg/m²

- Left knee examination:
  - Inspection: Mild bilateral genu varum (varus alignment), more apparent on left. No erythema. Mild warmth compared to contralateral side. Small effusion present (positive patellar tap, positive bulge sign).
  - Palpation: Moderate-to-significant medial joint line tenderness. Moderate lateral joint line tenderness. Tenderness over the medial collateral ligament origin. Mild pes anserine tenderness.
  - Range of motion: 5–112° (loss of full extension by 5° — new finding; flexion decreased from 118° in June). Significant crepitus throughout range. End-range flexion is painful.
  - Ligamentous stability: Varus/valgus stress stable but valgus stress produces pain at the medial joint line. Anterior/posterior drawer negative.
  - Patellofemoral: Patellar grind test mildly positive. No patellar apprehension.
  - Functional: Rises from chair using arm support (new — previously able to rise without arm support). Antalgic gait on left. Difficulty with tandem stance on left.
- Right knee: Mild-moderate medial joint line tenderness. Small osteophyte palpable at medial tibial plateau. ROM 0–122° (mildly decreased from 125°). Mild crepitus. No effusion. Stable.

WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index (self-reported, today):
- Pain subscale: 12/20 (previously 6/20 in August 2024)
- Stiffness subscale: 5/8 (previously 3/8)
- Physical function subscale: 32/68 (previously 18/68)
- Total: 49/96 (moderate-to-severe disability; significant worsening)

Numeric Pain Rating Scale: Left knee 7/10 with activity, 3/10 at rest, 4/10 nocturnal.

### Assessment
1. Left knee osteoarthritis — significant clinical and functional deterioration. New findings include: loss of full extension (5° flexion contracture), reduced flexion (112°), small effusion, new night pain, giving-way sensation (likely quadriceps insufficiency and pain inhibition rather than true instability), and inability to rise from chair without arm support. WOMAC score worsened from 27/96 to 49/96, indicating substantial functional decline. The pattern of diminishing injection response (10 weeks, then 8 weeks) combined with progressive clinical worsening suggests the disease is advancing beyond what can be managed with conservative measures alone. Imaging (2024) showed Kellgren-Lawrence Grade II–III; clinical examination today is consistent with further progression.
2. Right knee osteoarthritis — mildly worsening with decreased range of motion and increased pain, though still manageable.
3. Pes anserine bursitis, left — tenderness at the pes anserine insertion may be contributing to medial knee pain. This is a common concurrent finding with medial compartment OA and may respond to targeted physiotherapy.
4. Weight — stable at 65.2 kg. Despite best efforts, functional decline is limiting exercise capacity, which threatens both weight management and OA symptom control.
5. Deconditioning risk — progressive reduction in physical activity due to pain creates a negative cycle of muscle weakness, weight gain, and worsening OA symptoms.

### Plan
1. Referral to community physiotherapy — formal re-referral for 6–8 sessions of supervised physiotherapy, focusing on:
   - Quadriceps and hamstring strengthening (critical for joint stability and reducing giving-way)
   - Range of motion restoration (addressing developing flexion contracture)
   - Pes anserine bursitis management (ice, stretching, correction of gait biomechanics)
   - Gait retraining and balance exercises
   - Pool-based therapy if available (warm water exercise is particularly effective for knee OA with functional limitation)
   Referral written to Stratford physiotherapy clinic (closer to home) — patient covered for physiotherapy through employer benefits.
2. Repeat corticosteroid injection — left knee — offered. Patient declines today, preferring to start physiotherapy first and reassess. Reasonable approach. Injection remains available if needed — she is within safe frequency limits (last injection was January 2025, now 10 months ago).
3. Short course of oral NSAID for acute symptom management: Naproxen 500 mg PO BID with food, for 2 weeks, with Pantoprazole 40 mg PO daily for gastroprotection. Counselled on GI risks (dyspepsia, ulceration), cardiovascular risk (low at her age and risk profile), and renal effects. To be used as a short-term bridge while physiotherapy is initiated. Avoid combining with topical diclofenac during oral NSAID course to prevent excessive NSAID exposure.
4. After oral NSAID course, resume topical Diclofenac 1% gel PRN.
5. Continue Acetaminophen 500 mg PRN. May alternate with Naproxen during the 2-week oral NSAID course.
6. Night pain management — pillow positioning between knees is appropriate. Consider short-term use of Acetaminophen 1000 mg at bedtime if night pain is disruptive.
7. Continue Vitamin D3 1000 IU daily.
8. Discussed orthopedic referral — given progressive disease and diminishing response to conservative management, referral to orthopedics is becoming appropriate for further assessment including:
   - Updated imaging and comprehensive biomechanical assessment
   - Discussion of viscosupplementation (hyaluronic acid injection) as alternative to repeated corticosteroid injections
   - Surgical assessment (arthroscopy is generally not recommended for OA per current guidelines, but assessment for osteotomy or eventual arthroplasty may be warranted depending on progression)
   Patient agrees to orthopedic referral. Referral sent to Dr. Anthony Greco, MD FRCSC, Orthopedic Surgery, at Kingston Health Sciences Centre — Orthopedics. Wait time for consultation estimated at 4–6 months through OHIP. Patient understands the wait and is agreeable.
9. Workplace modifications — discussed with patient. Recommended:
   - Minimize stair use at work if possible (request ground-level duties)
   - Use a supportive chair with armrests to assist with sit-to-stand
   - Consider a knee sleeve or brace for stability during prolonged standing (over-the-counter neoprene sleeve)
10. Follow-up in 3 months, or sooner if symptoms significantly worsen, or when orthopedic appointment becomes available.

### Disposition
- Follow-up: 3 months (February 2026), or sooner as needed
- Referrals: Community physiotherapy (Stratford); Dr. Anthony Greco, MD FRCSC, Orthopedic Surgery — Kingston Health Sciences Centre (OHIP referral)
