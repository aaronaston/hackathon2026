   - Continue perindopril 8 mg PO daily.
   - Home BP monitoring: advised to check BP 2x/week (morning, before medication) and bring log to next visit.
   - Provided home BP monitoring instruction sheet.
2. **Cough:**
   - Discussed ACE inhibitor cough — explained this is a known class effect of perindopril affecting ~10-15% of patients.
   - Patient prefers to continue perindopril for now as cough is mild and not affecting sleep or driving.
   - Advised to report if cough worsens — will consider switch to telmisartan (ARB) if needed.
3. **Lifestyle counselling:**
   - Discussed DASH diet principles and practical tips for healthy eating on the road (pre-packed meals, avoiding fried foods at truck stops, increasing fruits and vegetables).

### Subjective

Mr. Dhillon returns for blood pressure follow-up and lab review. Bloodwork was completed 2024-08-08 (delayed from spring due to extended trucking route out west). He reports feeling well. The dry cough persists — now describes it as more frequent, occurring several times daily, worse in the evenings and when lying down. It is non-productive. No fever, no sputum, no hemoptysis. The cough has started to bother him during phone calls and at night. He is now interested in switching to a different medication if it might help.

Continues working full-time. Diet has improved somewhat — he purchased a small cooler and has been packing lunches 3-4 days per week. Still not exercising regularly. Home BP log shows readings ranging from 122/78 to 134/84 mmHg over the past 2 months, checked 2-3 times per week.

No chest pain, no palpitations, no dyspnea, no leg swelling. No urinary symptoms. No polyuria or polydipsia.

### Objective

**Vitals:**
- Blood pressure: 130/84 mmHg (left arm, seated, after 5 min rest)
- Blood pressure (repeat): 128/82 mmHg (right arm, seated)
- Heart rate: 72 bpm, regular

### Assessment

1. **Essential hypertension** — BP remains well controlled on perindopril. Home BP log consistent with in-office readings. Target achieved.
2. **ACE inhibitor-induced cough** — progressively bothersome dry cough, now impacting daily function. High clinical suspicion for perindopril-related cough. No alternative cause identified. Patient wishes to switch.
3. **Borderline triglycerides (1.8 mmol/L)** — likely dietary. Framingham Risk Score: low (<10% 10-year CVD risk). No indication for statin therapy at this time.
4. **Potassium 5.0 mmol/L (high-normal)** — at upper limit. Will monitor after ACE inhibitor switch to ARB (ARBs have lower but still present risk of hyperkalemia). No dietary potassium excess identified.
5. **Overweight** — modest weight loss (0.8 kg). Encouraged to continue dietary improvements.

### Plan

1. **Medication switch — ACE inhibitor to ARB:**
   - Discontinue perindopril 8 mg daily.
   - Start telmisartan 80 mg PO once daily (morning). Equivalent antihypertensive efficacy; no ACE inhibitor cough effect.
   - Rx: Telmisartan 80 mg, 1 tab PO daily, #90, 3 refills.
   - Counselled: cough typically resolves within 1-4 weeks of stopping ACE inhibitor. Continue home BP monitoring during switch.
2. **Recheck electrolytes (K+, creatinine) in 2-4 weeks** after starting telmisartan to monitor for hyperkalemia or renal function change.
   - Requisition provided: electrolytes, creatinine, eGFR.
3. **Triglycerides:**
   - Lifestyle modification: reduce refined carbohydrates and alcohol; increase omega-3 fatty acids (fish, walnuts, flaxseed).
   - Recheck fasting lipid profile at next annual.
4. **Lifestyle:**
   - Positive reinforcement for dietary changes and weight loss.
   - Continue encouraging physical activity during rest stops.
5. **Follow-up in 4-6 weeks** — for cough reassessment, BP check on new medication, and electrolyte review.

### Disposition

- **Follow-up:** 4-6 weeks (to be booked; patient will call when back from next haul).
- **Referrals:** None.

- **Reason for visit:** Left knee pain x 3 days

### Subjective

Mr. Dhillon presents to the walk-in clinic with a 3-day history of left knee pain. He reports the pain began after a long driving shift (14-hour day) during which he was sitting in his truck cab without breaks. He noticed stiffness and aching in the left knee upon exiting the cab. Over the following days the pain has persisted, worse with stair climbing and prolonged sitting. He describes the pain as a dull ache, localized to the anterior and medial aspect of the left knee, rated 5/10 at rest and 7/10 with stairs. No trauma, no fall, no twisting injury. No locking, no giving way, no audible pop. Mild swelling noted by patient. He has been taking ibuprofen 400 mg PRN (2-3 times/day for 2 days) with partial relief.

He mentions he is a regular patient of Dr. Angela Russo at Brampton Civic FHT but could not get an appointment this week and the knee pain is affecting his ability to work (clutch operation, climbing in/out of cab).

Current medications: telmisartan 80 mg daily (switched from perindopril in August 2024). Reports the cough resolved completely about 3 weeks after the switch. No other medications.

No fever, no redness of the joint, no other joint involvement. No history of gout. No back pain or radicular symptoms.

### Objective

**Vitals:**
- Blood pressure: 132/80 mmHg (left arm, seated)
- Heart rate: 76 bpm

- Range of motion: Flexion 0-125 degrees (mildly limited by discomfort at terminal flexion; normal side 0-135). Extension full (0 degrees).
- Ligamentous testing: Anterior drawer negative. Posterior drawer negative. Valgus stress test: no laxity at 0 and 30 degrees. Varus stress test: no laxity.
- McMurray test: Negative (no click or pain with rotation).
- Patellar grind test (Clarke's test): Mildly positive — reproduces anterior knee discomfort.
- Gait: Mild antalgic gait favoring the left side.

**Right knee:** Normal examination for comparison.

### Assessment

1. **Left knee pain — likely patellofemoral syndrome / medial compartment strain** secondary to prolonged static positioning in truck cab. No evidence of meniscal tear, ligamentous injury, or inflammatory arthritis. Mechanical etiology consistent with occupational posture.
2. **Hypertension** — noted on telmisartan 80 mg. BP 132/80 in walk-in setting, acceptable. Cough resolved after switch from perindopril. Will relay information to FP.

### Plan

1. **Left knee — conservative management:**
   - RICE protocol: relative rest (avoid aggravating activities), ice 15-20 min q4h, compression wrap as needed, elevation when resting.
   - Naproxen 500 mg PO BID with food x 7 days, then PRN. Rx: Naproxen 500 mg, #14, 0 refills. Advised to discontinue ibuprofen (switch to naproxen for more sustained relief). Cautioned re: NSAID use with ARB — short course acceptable but avoid prolonged use; monitor for ankle swelling or decreased urine output.
   - Quadriceps strengthening exercises: provided handout (straight leg raises, wall sits, terminal knee extensions). Begin once acute pain settles.
   - Adjust truck cab ergonomics: seat position, frequent micro-breaks every 2 hours (5 min walk-around), consider a small footrest to vary knee angle.
2. **Work:** Fit to drive with modifications. Advised to take micro-breaks. If not improving, may need brief time off.
3. **Communication:** Walk-in clinic note to be faxed to Dr. Angela Russo at Brampton Civic FHT (fax: 905-555-0148).
4. **Return if:** pain worsening, knee locking or giving way, significant swelling, fever, or not improving in 2 weeks.

### Disposition

- **Follow-up:** PRN or with family physician in 2-3 weeks if not resolving.
- **Referrals:** None. X-ray not indicated at this time (no trauma, no effusion, no bony tenderness, age <50 — Ottawa Knee Rules not met).
